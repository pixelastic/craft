The stonework would usually be covered in some kind of white-ish clay mixture. So you could paint the walls much less dark with a heavier white drybrush.\n\n1:42 BATTLEMENT BRICKS - It is easier to add texture (with aluminum foil ball) before you glue the bricks. You can also skip the \"cut the smaller bricks thinner\" part if you don't care about the Machicolations.\n\n2:06 GLUEING BRICKS - If you skip the machicolations, it will be much easier to glue the bricks onto the gatehouse.\n\n2:31 PAINTING - Paint Black → Grey → Light Grey → Off-white. To create a more natural look, you can add hints of brown, green and red to the paints.\n\n3:23 PLATFORM, DOOR, LADDER & PORTCULLIS GATE - Check out my quick tutorial for Wooden Stuff: https://youtu.be/437p1gwNNuE \n I just added some black to the silver paint I had laying around to create something that resembles iron.\n\n4:10 ASSEMBLY & SHOWCASE - All parts are easily removed and put back into place to enhance gameplay. The machicolations really do add to the playability and look to any d&d castle encounters.\nIf you have any similar ideas, past or future projects, please share!
