  "description": "Crafting piles of mini spell books or making large tomes with DMG's method could not be easier or faster, or cheaper. It is so cheap you could fill an entire dungeon tile for less than 5c. These are very useful in games of Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder and other RPG titles that use miniatures.\n\nSubscribe to DMG's other channel 7DSystem: https://www.youtube.com/7dsystem\n\n\nPurchase PDFs, Booklets or DVDs to support this channel - http://www.thedmg.info/store/\nWebsite - http://www.thedmg.info\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/thedmg.info\nLatest Subscriber Competition - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI96D3_2-yo\n\nDungeon tile construction technique was influenced by the 2.5D method created by DMScotty of theDM'sCraft.
