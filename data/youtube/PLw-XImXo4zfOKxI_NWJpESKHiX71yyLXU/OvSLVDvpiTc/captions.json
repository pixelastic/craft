  {
    "content": "can clean off the glue with finger again once it is cooled a little bit there you",

    "content": "and now we're going to measure one popsicle stick with in plus the drawer",

    "content": "so on a popsicle stick one popsicle stick within plus the drawer and then",

    "content": "another popsicle stick with on top of that so this is going to be forming the",

  {
    "content": "measure twice cut once so we need four of these to cut them out",

    "content": "and then we're going to get a match stick and we're going to measure the",

  {
    "content": "same length with match stick and we're going to do that with two matchsticks",

  {
    "content": "and just measure those inside edges as well just so that they line up and we'll",

  {
    "content": "grab another match stick and do the same thing and measuring the inside as well",

  {
    "content": "and just lop off the edges then we're going to grab one of the things we've",

  },
  {
    "content": "made for the top piece sorry the base of the drawer and stick down the popsicle",
    "start": 230
  },
  {
    "content": "stick and then we're going to stick the match stick to the other side all right",
    "start": 237

  {
    "content": "so the reason we're seeking the match stick on there is we want to extend the",

  },
  {
    "content": "length of this so the match stick is great because it helps you to extend",

  {
    "content": "that length and if you need more length you just add more popsicle sticks but",

  },
  {
    "content": "you'll see why in a moment so we've done the second one now one is the base one",

  },
  {
    "content": "is the top and so now that we've got the two we're going to grab the drawer and",

  },
  {
    "content": "just make sure that it's everything's aligned there and now we're going to get",

  {
    "content": "the back piece so measure it out aligned with the base and cut it out and stick",

  {
    "content": "it on top of the base not on side so that's on top of the base okay",

  },
  {
    "content": "now you'll see the drawer goes there but the drawer is overhanging the other side",
    "start": 289
  },
  {
    "content": "so we need to add an extra matchstick and this is where the matchsticks become",

  },
  {
    "content": "handy now the reason we didn't put it on the other side because if you had the",

  },
  {
    "content": "vertical on top of the matchstick it would just be a weaker so that's why",

    "content": "we're just adding more sticks more matchsticks on the what will be the open",

    "content": "side of the the draw case then we're going to measure measure the side so you",

  {
    "content": "want to measure the inside sides so that it goes flush to the open side of the",
    "start": 316

  {
    "content": "chest of the draw case and then line of hot glue down the backing and along the",
    "start": 324

    "content": "base and stick it in so you can see that that's flush with the open side and",

  },
  {
    "content": "flush with the back plate as well so again the other side cut that the same",
    "start": 335
  },
  {
    "content": "way and there we go and so here we have the base and the drawer as you can see",
    "start": 340
  },
  {
    "content": "here will fit in with the side that sticks up on the bat the back so now a",
    "start": 347
  },
  {
    "content": "blob of hot glue on each edge of on top of the open side of the case and put",
    "start": 354
  },
  {
    "content": "down a matchstick so once that is cured well before cures you want to clear out",
    "start": 362
  },
  {
    "content": "any glue that's on in the opening there so that when you do this with the drawer",
    "start": 367
  },
  {
    "content": "so the drawer slide in the long edge just sort of pop it underneath and then",
    "start": 372
  },
  {
    "content": "twist it so that it pops in and here you now have the drawer so it's better to do",
    "start": 378
  },
  {
    "content": "that while the top matchstick is still curing so that if it does give you any",
    "start": 384
  },
  {
    "content": "kind of leeway or so it does give you remove the matchstick or something you",
    "start": 390
  },
  {
    "content": "can just push it back into place so there you can see that long piece is",
    "start": 394
  },
  {
    "content": "stopping it is being stopped by the matchstick so we now have the drawer",
    "start": 397
  },
  {
    "content": "which will be very difficult to pull out unless you twist it out so then we just",
    "start": 402
  },
  {
    "content": "lop off the extra matchstick now we're going to just",
    "start": 408
  },
  {
    "content": "do the top sides and again the line of hot glue drop down a matchstick and do",
    "start": 412
  },
  {
    "content": "this on both sides hot glue down put down a matchstick and allow to cure and",
    "start": 419
  },
  {
    "content": "a lop off the excess now we just have the piece at the back so you're gonna",
    "start": 425
  },
  {
    "content": "grab a matchstick or an offcut or something measure what you need so that",
    "start": 430
  },
  {
    "content": "it will be flush to both sides at the top again light down hot glue and drop",
    "start": 435
  },
  {
    "content": "in the matchstick and wait for it to cure so at this point you've now got the",

  {
    "content": "drawer and you can actually now from this step create another one exactly",

    "content": "with what we've just shown you this whole procedure and you can stick it on",

  {
    "content": "put the top on once you've done your two or three layers so I'm just doing the",
    "start": 462
  },
  {
    "content": "one so you can just see what a single drawer is and now it's going to run hot",

    "content": "glue along the front and the sides on top and place down the top plate with",
    "start": 472

  {
    "content": "the matchstick edge towards the back so as you can see there's a magically",

    "content": "towards the back but there's obviously a space left so again put down some hot",

  {
    "content": "glue place a matchstick there and that fills in that gap then after you've",

    "content": "lopped off that just put a line of hot glue on the front of the drawer and drop",

    "content": "handle for the drawer and I like to just go over that once it's cured with a",

  {
    "content": "little bit more hot glue just to fasten it a little bit better because you're",

  {
    "content": "going to be pulling this in and out and it's going to be well you know I'm gonna",

  },
  {
    "content": "need that so there we go that draws in and you just pull it out so that's nice",
    "start": 520
  },
  {
    "content": "and easy so then we're gonna go a little bit different to normal painting",

    "content": "technique I'm gonna grab some ink now you can just use all the painting",

  {
    "content": "techniques that I've shown you doing wooden door",

  },
  {
    "content": "and things like that with us this is just an alternative this is essentially",

  {
    "content": "an ink wash so add a little bit of water to think and then I'm just going to",

  {
    "content": "brush over the entire piece with that brown ink and you can do this numerous",

  {
    "content": "times if you want us to activate Buddha speed boots of speed and away we go",

    "content": "and then you can just add some ink neat if you wish without watering it down to",

  },
  {
    "content": "get variations in the brown and this really makes it look pretty cool",

    "content": "so there you have it a nice drawer or you make a chest of drawers multiple",
