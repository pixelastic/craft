    "content": "but as you can see I base painted this thing white and not black the reason I",

  {
    "content": "did this is because the spray effect and the water and everything it's better",

  },
  {
    "content": "that the water is white then the water is black so I just did it that way",

    "content": "because ultimately it actually will be better off than having to repaint",
    "start": 529

  {

  {
    "content": "wouldn't recommend every single crafter to go in a white but occasionally you",
