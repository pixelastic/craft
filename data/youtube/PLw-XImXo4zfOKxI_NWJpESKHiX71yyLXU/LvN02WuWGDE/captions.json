    "content": "onto a card stock cut it out and fold it so that you can create the second side",

  {
    "content": "adds a little bit of flavor to it so that's why I did it",

    "content": "so just a hot-glue downside some toothpicks along there and repeat on the",

  {
    "content": "magical about them just push the boots as far back as possible and then shear",

    "content": "them off so now what we're going to do is hot glue across the top now this is a",

  {
    "content": "mistake that I made and what you should do is use a piece of card stock or a",

    "content": "piece of plastic or something and spread out the hot glue so that it's one thin",

    "content": "thinking what the hell are you doing well at this point I probably don't know",

  {
    "content": "what I'm doing but anyway again here with hot glue I should have spread it",
    "start": 334

  {
    "content": "out it does give a bit of a marble texture in the end but you'll see why",

  {
    "content": "I've been doing this for the tin foil and it's probably better if I had spread",
    "start": 344

  {
    "content": "it out so again hot glue the hot glue is hot and the heat transfer so it's very",
    "start": 348
  },
  {
    "content": "easily through tin foil so be careful and stick that tin foil as well down as",
    "start": 354
  },
  {
    "content": "possible and continue on with the hot glue and sticking down the 10th",
    "start": 361

  {
    "content": "now essentially what we're going to be doing here there's a lot of people who",
    "start": 365
  },
  {
    "content": "actually you will craft the firm and foam core and things like that foam core",
    "start": 370
  },
  {
    "content": "is not available everywhere and if it is in some places it can be quite expensive",
    "start": 375

    "content": "so this is an alternative to what you see in other videos like DM Scotties",

  {
    "content": "videos where he uses foam and the textures and things like that this is an",
    "start": 385
  },

    "content": "alternative method to that so what's nice about tin foil is tin foil tends to",

  {
    "content": "hold its shape once you have run over it with implements so you can see that the",
    "start": 397

    "content": "hot glue underneath here you can still see the ridges of it and that's why the",
    "start": 406
  },
  {
    "content": "it would have been better to smear it over with the plastic card or card stock",
    "start": 411
  },
  {
    "content": "just to flatten it out so all the excess tin foil is then trimmed off and we've",
    "start": 417

  {
    "content": "got a nice neat wrapped tin foil altar and now what we're going to do is we're",
