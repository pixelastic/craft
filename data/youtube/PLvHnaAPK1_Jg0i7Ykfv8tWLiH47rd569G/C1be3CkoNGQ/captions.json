    "content": "found this folder thingy and it has this plastic cover it's like a translucent",
    "start": 50
  },

  {
    "content": "working on the game and I wanted to have a like an archway and a gate so what I",
    "start": 62
  },
  {
    "content": "did was I made this out of the way I made a template for the size of the gate",
    "start": 68
  },
  {
    "content": "and then I traced it on some thin cardboard so I ended up with this okay",
    "start": 73
  },
  {
    "content": "now you can see I cut it out the shape of the template and then I cut inside so",
    "start": 80
  },
  {
    "content": "I just what I did was I drew inside and then I use an exacto knife I made a",
    "start": 88
  },
  {
    "content": "little easier to cut it out as opposed to trying to do with a large box cutter",
    "start": 95

    "content": "so I also traced on the that plastic and I got this shape and I use the thing I",

    "content": "between and you can see I did the edging on that so I just cut a strip of thin",

  {
    "content": "help that this is white cardboard so if you were using brown card what I would",

  {
    "content": "you'll see what what I have in mind so we're gonna paint the entire edging",

    "content": "was on the plastic but I can fix that when I glue it on the base I'll just",

  },
  {
    "content": "correct it but right now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to use a color called",

    "content": "I'll do is I'll move this other way and then I'll take the the portal and I'll",

  {
    "content": "that'll bring out those that detail we did with the glue gun and like I say",
    "start": 420
  },
  {
    "content": "this is a metallic so alright so now I will I'm gonna hit the other side to",

  {
    "content": "with it all right so we'll let that dry and then",

    "content": "that high Sheen said it'll make it definitely look magical because it's",

    "content": "here so here we are it's dried on the base",
