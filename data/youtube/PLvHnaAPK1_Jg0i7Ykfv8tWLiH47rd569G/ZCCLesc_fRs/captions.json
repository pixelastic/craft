    "content": "lighter areas you could are cresting water or something you could use the",

  {
    "content": "white to kind of dry brush or just add a little bit just a touch on on it to give",

  {
    "content": "it like a you know like a movement look like the water's moving now also you can",

  {
    "content": "do snow with this stuff - and you prime it E much wouldn't use the dark blue but",

  {
    "content": "what you could do is if you're doing snow you can use the glue gun or you",

  {
    "content": "know or even like just regular place and and you could paint it like a base blue",

  },
  {
    "content": "and then dry brush it with the white so that would give the effect of like ice",

  {
    "content": "or snow so that's kind of killed two birds with one stone with this set so",

    "content": "now I'm going to show you the next step you",

  {
    "content": "true red there are a lot of different colors of red make sure you get true red",

    "content": "it'd look better in your fire so yeah make sure you do that now showing the",

    "content": "technique for painting fire and smoldering something that's smoldering",

    "content": "glowing embers or fire or anything like that this is a color set you would use",

    "content": "I've got some flat black and I've got to texture paints now this is a stone like",

  {
    "content": "texture and this is a brown texture but I use it for dirt it works great for",
    "start": 526

    "content": "that so basically with the flat black you want to make sure it's flat black",

  {
    "content": "you don't want to get gloss black because the gloss black takes way longer",
    "start": 537

    "content": "to dry and it can be sticky so make sure that you get the gloss black I mean the",

  },
  {
    "content": "the flat black now if the texture paint this this stuff can be the most",
    "start": 547
  },
  {
    "content": "expensive part of the project so the technique I use as you've seen my videos",
    "start": 555
  },
  {
    "content": "I spray it with the flat black first and then I spray it with the other with the",
    "start": 559
  },
  {
    "content": "texture pin and the reason is because if you try to cover the cardboard the",
    "start": 565
  },
  {
    "content": "texture paint you're going to use way more texture paint you can if you do",
    "start": 568
  },
  {
    "content": "this technique with spring and black first and then using the texture paint",
    "start": 572
  },
  {
    "content": "you can save a like it this would go four times longer than if you just spray",
    "start": 576
  },
  {
    "content": "it with the texture paint so this is the most expensive part so definitely you",
    "start": 581
  },
  {
    "content": "want to save on this so use your flat black which is really cheap just buy the",
    "start": 586
  },
  {
    "content": "cheapest you can buy you don't need an you don't mean the really expensive flat",

  {
    "content": "blacks just get the cheap stuff I got this in a big-box store so those are",
    "start": 595
  },
  {
    "content": "basically the spray paints and just remember to use your flat black and you",
    "start": 602
  },
  {
    "content": "can make these go much longer without having a new can now one thing is these",
    "start": 608
  },
  {
    "content": "may not be the exact color you want but you can always fix that like if you want",
    "start": 613
  },
  {
    "content": "if you want it to be the gray to be darker you could use you can dust it",
    "start": 618

  {
    "content": "with the flat black so say you spray the gray and then you hit it with a flat",
    "start": 624

  {
    "content": "black a little bit that'll make it a darker color without covering up the",

    "content": "entire gray surface so that's a good technique for making something darker if",

  },
  {
    "content": "you want to make it darker and those are our basic spray paints",

    "content": "so here we go last but not least I have this I have a water-based garnish this",

  {
    "content": "stuff is great this isn't that the actual can of course",
