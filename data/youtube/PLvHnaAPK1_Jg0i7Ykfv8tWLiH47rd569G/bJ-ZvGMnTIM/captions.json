  {
    "content": "pillar it's not gonna look like a tree so what I want to do is kind of crush it",

    "content": "kind of get some glue on there as you can see this could be a bit messy okay",

  {
    "content": "the nice adhesion to the tree and so we got a lot really nice texture already",

    "content": "right built right into that in that fantastic all right so now I'm going to",

    "content": "as much to you know say if you put on a table or something or a piece of",

    "content": "I would let it dry for at least a couple days it's pretty wet what I would do is",

  {
    "content": "quite solid but give it a few days and it'll it'll firm up quite a bit all",

  },
  {
    "content": "right so now we'll go on to the next step all right guys so here's my tree",
    "start": 395
  },
  {
    "content": "trunk and it's all dry it's nice and hard no jokes please okay so now I need",
    "start": 404
  },
  {
    "content": "to secure it so I can move to the next step so what I'm going to do is just use",

  {
    "content": "a piece of junk cardboard I'm not using this for the base I'm just going to",
    "start": 417

  {
    "content": "secure it to this so I will put some glue put a good amount of hot glue on",
    "start": 422
  },
  {
    "content": "there and stick it to the base here all right",
    "start": 430
  },
  {
    "content": "so now I'm just going to let that sit for a minute and then we'll move to the",
    "start": 438
  },
  {
    "content": "next step so here we go it's nice and firm oh okay so it's stuck to the base",
    "start": 443
  },
  {
    "content": "and the reason I'm doing this is to add some more detail to the bottom here okay",
    "start": 453
  },
  {
    "content": "and it can be a bit messy so it's probably easier to do with on the gel",
    "start": 459
  },
  {
    "content": "cardboard that would be to try to do it on the base I I would also do multiple",
    "start": 462
  },
  {
    "content": "of these at the same time so of course I'm just making one for demonstration",
    "start": 469
  },
  {
    "content": "but if you're going to make a bunch I would make them all at the same time",
    "start": 473
  },
  {
    "content": "okay so to move on we're use our figure this toilet paper and going to get it",
    "start": 475
  },
  {
    "content": "wet in our water this is just water so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to",
    "start": 484
  },
  {
    "content": "start gluing the side here okay and I'm going to start putting on the toilet",
    "start": 488
  },
  {
    "content": "paper on the side there okay and I'm going to keep going around so I grab",
    "start": 503
  },
  {
    "content": "another one get it wet squeeze out most of the water",
    "start": 506
  },
  {
    "content": "my glue on there and secure that so now I'm going to keep",
    "start": 517
  },
  {
    "content": "going around and putting these on the base and these will be used to look like",
    "start": 524
  },
  {
    "content": "the tree is is branching out at the bottom for the root system so it gives a",
    "start": 532
  },
  {
    "content": "really nice look to the tree and see that that's starting to shape up right",
    "start": 537
  },
  {
    "content": "there so now I'll just continue around the tree and then we'll come back also",
    "start": 541
  },
  {
    "content": "when you're doing these make sure when you after you glue them on there the",
    "start": 546
  },
  {
    "content": "tree like that put the glue underneath and put some glue on top of them too and",
    "start": 551
  },
  {
    "content": "then rub it in like we normally do okay that'll make it nice and hard and blend",
    "start": 554
  },
  {
    "content": "writing them right in with the tree so there we go I'll keep going around the",
    "start": 561
  },
  {
    "content": "base here and finish this up so when we're going for the move on to the next",
    "start": 564
  },
  {
    "content": "step alright so my tree is all dried and they're going to be look at it there",
    "start": 567
  },
  {
    "content": "okay so now I want to take it off this base okay I just use this to build this",
    "start": 578
  },
  {
    "content": "tree I'm not going to keep it on this base alright so what I'm going to do is",
    "start": 586
  },
  {
    "content": "just rip it off so just start bending the cardboard away from the tree base",
    "start": 590
  },
  {
    "content": "like that and there you go you got the tree off and it's all ready to go",
    "start": 595
  },
  {
    "content": "now I did that because it's going to be easier for the next step which is the",
    "start": 600
  },
  {
    "content": "detailing step so we'll move on to that when I have some branches to my tree now",
    "start": 604
  },
  {
    "content": "so it's just kind of a plain trunk right now so I'm going to do is I'm going to",
    "start": 613
  },
  {
    "content": "take some of these sticks now these sticks are tapered all right look at",
    "start": 616
  },
  {
    "content": "that see there there's pointed on that end and they're wider at that end all",
    "start": 623
  },
  {
    "content": "right I'll take a three of these that one's kind of",
    "start": 628
  },
  {
    "content": "all right so I'm going to use three alright so what I'll do is I will take",
    "start": 637
  },
  {
    "content": "my punch and just kind of rip up the trunk there punch right into the trunk",
    "start": 646
  },
  {
    "content": "now I'm going to hit it with hot glue alright and then I will take this branch",
    "start": 652
  },
  {
    "content": "and do it this way alright now the branch I'm doing flat kind of see how I",
    "start": 660
  },
  {
    "content": "did that alright that way I could build up some",
    "start": 669
  },
  {
    "content": "texture on I'll show you that in a minute okay",
    "start": 672
  },
  {
    "content": "so I'll put the rest of these branches in and I'll move on to the next step now",
    "start": 674
  },
  {
    "content": "as you can see from my tree trunk I had that coming out of various distances",
    "start": 678
  },
  {
    "content": "from the tree trunk okay so now what I want to do is I'm going to build texture",
    "start": 683
  },
  {
    "content": "on this all right so I'll take my hot glue gun and see this branch here I'm",
    "start": 687
  },
  {
    "content": "going to start building up some texture on it now I want to do the top two I",
    "start": 693
  },
  {
    "content": "don't want to do the tip because I'm going to apply some more branch to that",
    "start": 701
  },
  {
    "content": "and they're going to include leaves on the branch so I don't want to cover up",
    "start": 706
  },
  {
    "content": "the tip all right but I'm trying to get some dimension to that branch and you",
    "start": 712
  },
  {
    "content": "can let that cool for a few minutes and then build up some more usually it's a",
    "start": 716
  },
  {
    "content": "good idea to do a couple of passes on those branches so now that I've got that",
    "start": 720
  },
  {
    "content": "I'll do the rest of the branches what I'm going to start doing is pulling the",
    "start": 725
  },
  {
    "content": "glue gun down on the trunk now the loop the smaller glue gun works better for",
    "start": 730
  },
  {
    "content": "this it's easier to get this kind of detail into the trunk so so this does",
    "start": 733
  },
  {
    "content": "two things it gives it a really nice detail as far as the bark on these trees",
    "start": 737
  },
  {
    "content": "and it also gives it a lot of strength so these are really some nice trees",
    "start": 743
  },
  {
    "content": "alright and so I'm just going to continue that like I said I'll build up",
    "start": 749
  },
  {
    "content": "the branches and then mark on the tree and then we'll come back for the next",
    "start": 754
  },
  {
    "content": "step alright guys so I've applied all the",
    "start": 757
  },
  {
    "content": "texture to the tree and I'll give you a kind of a close up there so see that see",
    "start": 765
  },
  {
    "content": "how nice that looks and then take a close look at the branch see I've built",
    "start": 769
  },
  {
    "content": "out some bulk on the branch with that glue gun so it's not doesn't look just",
    "start": 774
  },
  {
    "content": "like a straight stick so that's a nice little technique and you can see that I",
    "start": 781
  },
  {
    "content": "only put really three branches on this because the goal of these trees is to",
    "start": 787
  },
  {
    "content": "just give kind of the illusion that it is you know a large forest did not",
    "start": 791
  },
  {
    "content": "obstruct play okay so there we go there's a there's the tree now we'll",
    "start": 797
  },
  {
    "content": "move on to the next step so here I've made a base for the tree",
    "start": 803
  },
  {
    "content": "and it's just a thin cardboard it's actually found a FedEx box okay so I cut",
    "start": 809
  },
  {
    "content": "it rather large because when you do the tree like this you want to give the base",
    "start": 815
  },
  {
    "content": "enough room because the branches are going to kind of be coming off of this",
    "start": 819
  },
  {
    "content": "okay and I don't want it to tip over so I want to give the base I want to make",
    "start": 823
  },
  {
    "content": "the base big enough so it won't be a problem",
    "start": 828
  },
  {
    "content": "okay so before I attach the tree what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my",
    "start": 830
  },
  {
    "content": "large glue gun and I'm going to kind of fill in the base with just some texture",
    "start": 835
  },
  {
    "content": "so I'll just do the glue gun on the base so I'll just keep doing this and then",
    "start": 840
  },
  {
    "content": "I'll fill on the base and that will move on to the next step",
    "start": 845
  },
  {
    "content": "this just gives it so it's not just a flat texture it gives it a little bit of",
    "start": 847
  },
  {
    "content": "variation in the and it in the texture itself it's not just a flat base",
    "start": 851
  },
  {
    "content": "the bass may want to bend a little bit so you can always bend it over back into",
    "start": 864
  },
  {
    "content": "shape if it does these larger bases can do this when you apply the hot glue so",
    "start": 869
  },
  {
    "content": "just bend it a little bit back into shape and get it flat okay so now we're",
    "start": 874
  },
  {
    "content": "going to apply the tree all right so I'll grab the tree trunk and I'm going",
    "start": 882
  },
  {
    "content": "to apply a generous helping of hot glue attach it to the piece all right we can",
    "start": 889
  },
  {
    "content": "let that dry for a minute all right harden up for a minute so now what you",
    "start": 905
  },
  {
    "content": "can do is you can kind of fill this in just take the glue go around the edge",
    "start": 909
  },
  {
    "content": "kind of pull it and just work your way around blended it into the base and then",
    "start": 915
  },
  {
    "content": "we'll move it into the next step which is a little bit of detailing all right",
    "start": 926
  },
  {
    "content": "so one of the detailing techniques I'm going to do is you've seen me do before",
    "start": 937
  },
  {
    "content": "and he's the white glue and just start making some this is a little wobbly",
    "start": 940
  },
  {
    "content": "because this tray I'm using has a relief so it's not the base itself all right so",
    "start": 946
  },
  {
    "content": "I'll just kind of make some piles around the base and this will give some nice",
    "start": 953
  },
  {
    "content": "texture also to the base all right and now it's just a simple matter of taking",

    "content": "my construction sand which I've talked about the for if there's anything that I",

  {
    "content": "use okay so I'm going to take a cup of construction sand and just pour it over",
    "start": 982
  },
  {
    "content": "these piles of PVA glue so now just let this dry and then I'll move on to the",

    "content": "coming off of my large tree so I'm going to do is just take my regular scissors",
