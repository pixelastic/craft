    "content": "okay so I've got all my pieces on there okay so now I've got all my pieces but I",

    "content": "have a problem normally when I cut out to a regular shape tile I would cut out",

    "content": "that so I'll just take my tile turn it upside",

    "content": "down put it on the cardboard and then I'm going to trace around it so that'll",

  {
    "content": "be my first edge okay so I got that so now I'll do my",

  },

    "content": "second one so now I'll trace it drive it with",

    "content": "so now what I'll do is I'll cut these out and then we'll attach them to the",

    "content": "the tile so the problem with this kind of tile is",

  },

    "content": "getting the edging on because there are separate tears on the time now I've",
    "start": 598

    "content": "already done this side and I'll show you how to do this side so you can't really",

  {
    "content": "glue it on like this because it's it'll look weird going up and down on these",
    "start": 614
  },
  {
    "content": "edges so what I do is I will measure with the piece and I'll just eyeball it",
    "start": 618
  },
  {
    "content": "and I'll trim it so what I'll do is I will glue the edging here and I've just",

  },
  {
    "content": "got like a little piece of the edging and I'll put it on there now that's",

  },
  {
    "content": "sticking off the end but I'll just trim that later and it's definitely quite",

  },
  {
    "content": "when you cut the edging you sometimes it gets a little wonky it never quite ends",
    "start": 649
  },
  {
    "content": "up right so you may have to trim some so we'll keep that in mind so there we go",
    "start": 653
  },
  {
    "content": "so now we will do the next part so I will measure from there",
    "start": 661
  },
  {
    "content": "so now I need to put this on there now as you can see it doesn't quite fit so",
    "start": 685
  },
  {
    "content": "what I'm gonna do is I'm going to cut it in the center that way I'll be able to",
    "start": 690
  },
  {
    "content": "fast but I need to know how far I need to glue to so I'll go from there",
    "start": 694
  },
  {
    "content": "there and I'll mark it there so I know how far to glue",
    "start": 701
  },
  {
    "content": "so now see that's not quite right a little bit and that why is that much",
    "start": 718
  },
  {
    "content": "better so now I need to go out of this ledge here",
    "start": 729
  },
  {
    "content": "from that this is basically just like doing it a regular title you're just",
    "start": 735
  },
  {
    "content": "adding cutting it the different at the separate layers so now put a mark there",
    "start": 753
  },
  {
    "content": "and don't worry if you got some gaps you can always fill it in with the blue but",
    "start": 786

  {
    "content": "you invariably will with with your regular tiles okay so you notice this",
    "start": 796
  },
  {
    "content": "tile kind of wants to bow a little bit what I what you can do is you can kind",
    "start": 806
  },
  {
    "content": "of just bend it a little bit you can already do that with the hand or tiles",
    "start": 810
  },
  {
    "content": "too if they're trying to throw now help flatten it out you could also put",

  {
    "content": "cardboard underneath each of these shells but I never really do I don't",
    "start": 826
  },
  {
    "content": "really think you need to so now what I'm going to do is I'll just trim those",

  },
  {
    "content": "edges off so now I've got my entrances and exit I",
    "start": 836
  },

    "content": "got the shelves in here and then I'll just do what I do for every irregular",

    "content": "tile I'll get my glue gun and I'm gonna feel",
    "start": 860
  },
  {
    "content": "a little areas here but I will put some glue on there and then just kind of",
    "start": 865
  },
  {
    "content": "smear it back just kind of get some texture to the wall areas now with these",
    "start": 869

  {
    "content": "types of tiles where stuff hangs over a lot it's a good idea to kind of",

  },
  {
    "content": "along the edge the shelves so that they're nice and on there and then just",
    "start": 893
  },
  {
    "content": "go over the whole tile and do that that just makes them extra secure so yeah",
    "start": 914
  },
  {
    "content": "so now I've got all my edging done see on there now I'm going to have a couple",

    "content": "of pillars in the center of the room basically they're like big clumps of",

    "content": "like I do in my all my Mike layers so I'll just start putting in the roots",

  {
    "content": "like I've shown any other video all right so I think I've got all my",
    "start": 963
  },
  {
    "content": "roots on there and there we go that's what it looks like another",
    "start": 976
  },
  {
    "content": "feature I'm going to have on this tile is I'm going to have these small tunnels",
    "start": 985

  {
    "content": "that might come out of and basically it's a continuous stream lights if the",
    "start": 989
  },
  {
    "content": "it'd be very difficult for the players to go down those tunnels because they're",
    "start": 995
  },
  {
    "content": "going to be very small tunnels just a few feet wide",
    "start": 998
  },
  {
    "content": "so basically players won't even be able to fit in those tunnels while my players",
    "start": 1003
  },
  {
    "content": "are regular size they're no small characters so it'd be virtually",
    "start": 1007
  },
  {
    "content": "impossible for them to go back down but mites will continue to pour out so I",
    "start": 1013

  {
    "content": "could simulate that by cutting a hole in the tile like I've done before but I",
    "start": 1018

  {
    "content": "think I'm since they're they're small holes I'm going to kind of do a",

  {
    "content": "technique by using the glue gun so what I want to do is I want to mark on the",

    "start": 1043

  {
    "content": "this one here and on this one I'll do to see I'll be pretty difficult before the",

  {
    "content": "forth and then what I'll do is I will paint that in to make it really stand",
