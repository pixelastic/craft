  {
    "content": "here but I have a back area which will have a regular door won't have a glass",

  {
    "content": "door and as you can see these are two separate tiles so they can just go",

  {
    "content": "together like that okay so that's our second tile and let's move on to the",

  },
  {
    "content": "next one on this tile I did a different floor",
    "start": 222
  },

  },
  {
    "content": "checkerboard pattern I just use a sponge cut into a square and then dipped it",
    "start": 229
  },
  {
    "content": "with a white paint and then just stamped it on the tile itself so it gives that",
    "start": 235

  {
    "content": "kind of checkerboard pattern but it also gave a nice look of being old and",
    "start": 240
  },
  {
    "content": "scuffed up because it's not a solid solid pattern so I thought that was kind",

  },
  {
    "content": "of nice also you notice something different I did different on this tile",

    "content": "watered it down so I washed it i watch the floor so it kind of gave that look",
