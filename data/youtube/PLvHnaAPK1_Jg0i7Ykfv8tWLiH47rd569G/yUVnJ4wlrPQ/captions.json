  },
  {
    "content": "base okay so let's let's still give it some texture without making it too wide",

  },
  {
    "content": "on the bottom so that the other piece won't fit so I'll finish this up and",

  },
  {
    "content": "then we'll move on to the next step so here I've done my sponge technique",
    "start": 130
  },
  {
    "content": "and you can see that it really look makes that tea light look like stone and",
    "start": 140
  },
  {
    "content": "that was the reason I use I scuffed it up a bit with the sandpaper so that",
    "start": 143
  },
  {
    "content": "paint would stick better to the base I also you can also see that I've washed",

  },
  {
    "content": "the flame with a light yellow wash just to give it a nice coloring and now we",

  {
    "content": "okay so I'm going to go ahead and cut those and then I'm going to glue them on",
    "start": 201
  },
  {
    "content": "and I'm not going to use the hot glue I'm actually going to use a little bit",

    "start": 227
  },
  {
    "content": "and it gives a nice appearance of that and what I'll do is I'll paint it flat",

  },
  {
    "content": "black and then paint it up with some metallics",
    "start": 238

  {
    "content": "so it's like it looks like the brazier is actually sitting on top of a pedestal",
    "start": 287

  {
    "content": "if you want it and you can see the nice texture on the light there and then you",
