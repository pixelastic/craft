  {
    "content": "some areas on the black so it's not just pure black and I kind of do the edge",

  },
  {
    "content": "there and now I'm going to do the dusty purple",
    "start": 420
  },
  {
    "content": "it's a very strange color so with this wet this very wet black it's almost",

  },
  {
    "content": "dissolving into the into the black so it's doing a strange kind of blend",

    "content": "I'd do some more royal purple alright see if I can show you that I know that's",
    "start": 461
  },
  {
    "content": "very dark so it's hard to see but the color when this it's even more",
    "start": 474
  },
  {
    "content": "pronounced now but when the color effect dries it's going to be even harder to",
    "start": 479
  },
  {
    "content": "see but it'll be just enough of a variance to make it not just a straight",
    "start": 484
  },
  {
    "content": "black so make it a little more interesting so now I'm going to let this",

  },
  {
    "content": "dry and then we'll move on to the next step",
    "start": 492
  },
  {
    "content": "so now that my spell effect circle is dried the effect is less pronounced and",

  },
  {
    "content": "I actually wanted so I'm going to apply some more purple with the template dry",

  },
  {
    "content": "sometimes this will happen sometimes you'll try an effect and it's a good",

  {
    "content": "lesson sometimes we'll try an effect and it didn't quite come out how you wanted",
    "start": 519
  },
  {
    "content": "it but it's just paint you can just paint right over it so that's exactly",
    "start": 522
  },
  {
    "content": "what I'm going to do so I'm gonna use my bigger brush again and pick up some that",
    "start": 526
  },
  {
    "content": "darker purple and I'm kind of kind of suck it on there or I should say dab it",
    "start": 529
  },
  {
    "content": "on there and I'm actually going to do that I think the edge is a little bit so",

  },
  {
    "content": "I'll pick that sucker up okay",
    "start": 547
  },
  {
    "content": "so you can see I got a little more on there now I'm going to use that weird",
    "start": 558
  },
  {
    "content": "dusty purple and that's like a lighter purple but it's not too happy that's",
    "start": 564
  },
  {
    "content": "what I like about it it's kind of a reddish purple just kind of lightly hit",
    "start": 571
  },
  {
    "content": "it I do a little more towards the center I think uh put a few on the up out there",
    "start": 578
  },
  {
    "content": "all right I think I'm happy with that now so that's hard to see because it's",
    "start": 598
  },
  {
    "content": "wet and it's black but let that dry and then we'll move to the next step but",
    "start": 603
  },
  {
    "content": "like I said you may try something and it just may not quite have come out how you",
    "start": 609
  },
  {
    "content": "wanted it I want the purple to be a little more prominent so I decided that",
    "start": 614
  },
  {
    "content": "after it dried I was going to add a little more a little more purple and",
    "start": 618
  },
  {
    "content": "always remembered that the paint will be darker generally darker when it dries",
    "start": 621
  },
  {
    "content": "it'll look lighter when you initially put it on could when it's still wet but",
    "start": 626
  },
  {
    "content": "it'll dry up a little darker so always keep that in mind",
    "start": 630
  },
  {
    "content": "so here we go I have my room set up and I have my three heroes here and the",

  },
  {
    "content": "enemy caster so it turns out the enemy caster goes first and he has range so",
    "start": 642
  },
  {
    "content": "what he would do is I could just take the template that I used it's the",
    "start": 648
  },
  {
    "content": "negative energy template and he it actually covers all three hero so I just",
    "start": 652
  },
  {
    "content": "pick them up put them underneath so they're all inside the negative energy",
    "start": 656
  },
  {
    "content": "so then you roll to hit for each one in this case it's a real power attack so",

  },
  {
    "content": "you roll the hit for each one and depending if you hit you take damage but",

    "content": "blackness so the player is essentially blind so they might get confused which",

    "content": "direction they're going so what I do is I have them make an intelligence check",
    "start": 689

  {
    "content": "and if they make it they can they can exit the severe where they want to if",
    "start": 693

  {
    "content": "they don't they'll exit the sphere at a random point so what I have for that is",

    "content": "I have a sketch called a scatter dye it's used a lot in war games to show a",
