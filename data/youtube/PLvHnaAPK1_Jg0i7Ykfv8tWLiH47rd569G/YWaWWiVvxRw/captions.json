  {
    "content": "your tiles and let's get right to it all right let's talk about stairs now",
    "start": 16
  },
  {
    "content": "you have several options when you decide to do stairs you see I've got different",
    "start": 27
  },
  {
    "content": "ones here I've got these which are a taller stair these are only half inch",
    "start": 30
  },
  {
    "content": "each these are an inch each and these are made out of cardstock and there's",
    "start": 39
  },
  {
    "content": "definitely uses for those or if you didn't want to have the height of actual",
    "start": 44
  },
  {
    "content": "stairs but simulate stairs you could use those and these these are made of these",
    "start": 48
  },
  {
    "content": "half-inch are made out of 1/2 or a small cardboard and these stairs are made out",
    "start": 54
  },
  {
    "content": "of regular cardboard so they're taller but I've got each step is an inch so if",
    "start": 59
  },
  {
    "content": "I put the character on you can see he doesn't fit on each step but with these",
    "start": 66
  },
  {
    "content": "inch steps the character fits on each step and can stand on it ok so the",
    "start": 73
  },
  {
    "content": "basics of steps are very easy so I'll move these away and show you this one",
    "start": 80
  },
  {
    "content": "here this is your basic step okay I've got just got four steps now what I did",
    "start": 88
  },
  {
    "content": "was I cut a two inch wide four inch long strip then I cut a three inch long strip",
    "start": 95
  },
  {
    "content": "two inches wide another two inch wide strip but only two inches and then just",
    "start": 103
  },
  {
    "content": "one inch wide or one inch wide two inches long so there you go that's just",
    "start": 108
  },
  {
    "content": "the basic step and so what I do is I just stack these on top of each other",
    "start": 116
  },
  {
    "content": "and you can see now I've got a step so then just put those in your room and",
    "start": 125
  },
  {
    "content": "you'll be sent with the steps so what I wanted to do was I'll glue this together",
    "start": 135
  },
  {
    "content": "and then I wanted to show you what it was like in a room so I'll go ahead and",

  },
  {
    "content": "do that and make sure when you light and you put the steps together that you line",
    "start": 144
  },
  {
    "content": "them up correctly a little string there you good way to do it is to put it on",
    "start": 160
  },
  {
    "content": "its back so there we go we've got the two steps and now I'll get the next step",
    "start": 165
  },
  {
    "content": "make sure it's lined up so now we've got our step and it's all",

  {
    "content": "ready for adventure and there's a guy for scale now what I was going to do is",

  },
  {
    "content": "say we had a Wizards Tower so I grabbed this room I've made and I'm gonna put",
    "start": 200
  },
  {
    "content": "the step in so say this step was at the back of the room I've got a door here",
    "start": 211
  },
  {
    "content": "and then I've got the steps here so when I make the next tile it will the steps",

  },
  {
    "content": "will come up from the same spot so when you make a tile that's like a tower or",

  },
  {
    "content": "something you can just make the same tile over and over say you have five",

  },
  {
    "content": "floors or something you can just make the same tile over and but I'm gonna",

  },
  {
    "content": "show you an interesting way to simulate the stairs going up into the next level",
    "start": 238
  },
  {
    "content": "so let me show you that okay I've got our next floor tile here",
    "start": 242
  },
  {
    "content": "it's the same exact size as the one below it and this there's no door",
    "start": 251
  },
  {
    "content": "because the door was on the first floor now the stairs were coming up here so I",

  },
  {
    "content": "want to simulate that this is the next floor where the stairs came up so a neat",
    "start": 262
  },
  {
    "content": "way to do that would be to I have these card stock stairs and what I'll do is",

  },
  {
    "content": "I'll measure where the stairs were so now I'm going to cut that out",
    "start": 270

    "content": "but here I've cut my hole out and that's where the stairs would come up from the",
    "start": 283

  {
    "content": "other floor what I'm going to do is glue some card stock to the bottom of the",

  },
  {
    "content": "tile so I'll glue around the edge and then stick the car tectus talk to this",

  },
  {
    "content": "tile and there we go that's filled in so now",
    "start": 299
  },
  {
    "content": "what I can do is to simulate those stairs coming up I can glue the other",

    "content": "pieces of cardstock I've cut that match the stairway that I've that I made so",

  {
    "content": "I'll put the next smaller went in there and then I'll do the next smaller",
    "start": 323
  },
  {
    "content": "so now I've got the top step glued on and so that would simulate someone come",

  },
  {
    "content": "up the steps and then they would be on the tile coming up the steps you",
    "start": 360
  },
  {
    "content": "wouldn't have to do this you could do a smaller exit where the characters come",
    "start": 367
  },

    "content": "out you would have to show the full stairway if you didn't want to but",
    "start": 372
  },
  {
    "content": "that's kind of a neat way to simulate the stairs coming up you can also do",
    "start": 375
  },
  {
    "content": "that on tiles where you don't have the room to do a full stairway if you wanted",

  {
    "content": "to have stairs going up to a tile but you didn't want to use the whole",

  {
    "content": "stairway because it would be too too big on the tile it'd be coming over the edge",

    "content": "of the tile so you could do this technique the cardstock technique so",

  },
  {
    "content": "there we go there's our basic stairways and you can always do curved stairways",

    "content": "or spiral stairways just using the same techniques just cutting smaller and",

    "content": "smaller pieces to simulate the stairs and just remember if you're going to do",

  },
  {
    "content": "the regular card cardboard stairs is probably better to do them bigger",
    "start": 418

    "content": "because you the characters might fall over if you do them with the smaller",

  },

    "content": "to make it so the characters wouldn't be falling like this so there you go and",

  {
    "content": "the base floor of our wizards tower with the stairs in place so we have a doorway",

  },
  {
    "content": "as you can see they come off the tile you could make them come off the tile or",
    "start": 459
  },
  {
    "content": "you could glue them to the tile either way so I put a figure on there to show",
    "start": 464
  },
  {
    "content": "you the scale so there we go and as the as the adventurers go up the",

    "content": "tower you can switch out to the next tile and here's the same set of stairs",

    "content": "just going up into the tower now these are just the card stock stairs that I",
