    "content": "now unlike a moderate Road a regular Road isn't going to be straight so",

    "content": "totally straight so I'm going to do is I'm just going to kind of freehand it",

  },
  {
    "content": "should say now the reason I like to use poster board and besides the cardboard",

  {
    "content": "is it tends not to curl as much as the cardboard so especially in the long",
    "start": 329
  },

    "content": "strips like this because I have no edging on here just so I done it doesn't",

    "content": "look like I'm watering rarity and if you did want to do a mile road you just",

    "content": "would cut it straight of course I would make it wider this is more of a horse",

    "content": "make a few like kind of like jogs or turrent where the road kind of turns",

    "content": "what I'm going to do is I'm going to measure four from this corner so I'll",

  },
  {
    "content": "will allow me to give a little bit of jog in the road so so this way here I'll",

  },
  {
    "content": "just pull it and I want to make sure I end up with",
    "start": 396
  },
  {
    "content": "the part here and then I'll pull this one and I'm just eyeballing this the",
    "start": 406
  },
  {
    "content": "only important thing is that the ends match not the middle so if you're a",
    "start": 413
  },
  {
    "content": "little off in the middle that's okay there we go I've got that kind of",
    "start": 421
  },
  {
    "content": "jogging road there now cut it out all right so now we have that curve written",
    "start": 425
  },
  {
    "content": "that nice curved road now the nice thing about this is see I've got this here I",
    "start": 430
  },
  {
    "content": "could just put this connect it with the road here and it kind of turns like that",
    "start": 439
  },
  {
    "content": "I could also connect this end here so it's a nice curved road but it's still I",
    "start": 447
  },
  {
    "content": "can still make a longer road if I want and you can do any shapes and sizes of",
    "start": 460
  },
  {
    "content": "the roads that you wanted to do so what I'm going to do now now now I need to",

  },
  {
    "content": "worry about the detail on this road so I'll go to that part",
    "start": 469
  },
  {
    "content": "now what I'm making is an old Imperial road so part a lot of it has degraded",

  {
    "content": "but there are parts where the cobblestones still show through most of",

    "start": 488
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm going to make a stamp to show those parts of cobblestones so what I'm going",
    "start": 494
  },
  {
    "content": "to do is I'm going to use this foam sheet and you can get these at dollar",
    "start": 499
  },
  {
    "content": "stores any craft store any big-box store it's just a it's just a foam sheet and",
    "start": 505
  },
  {
    "content": "these are in the craft section they're very cheap what I'm going to do is use a",
    "start": 511
  },
  {
    "content": "ballpoint pen in my ruler and so what I want to do is I'm going to measure a",
    "start": 514

  {
    "content": "half-inch and I'm going to then divide that so quarter of an inch and the side",
    "start": 519

  {
    "content": "too and then I'm going to just connect the the two",

  },
  {
    "content": "it's become clear why I'm doing this this okay",
    "start": 551
  },
  {
    "content": "so now I've got that now what I want to do is I'm gonna cut this out okay so",

  {
    "content": "I've got that strip now what I want to do is I'm going to do quarter-inch",

  {
    "content": "markings on this but what I'm going to do is set a marking I'm just going to",

  {
    "content": "pull all the way up so I'll just it doesn't have to be perfectly straight",

  },
  {
    "content": "this is an old cobblestone road that's degraded",
    "start": 585
  },
  {
    "content": "that should be enough okay so now you can see I've got all those little marks",
    "start": 597
  },
  {
    "content": "the little boxes now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cut the two boxes so I'll",
    "start": 604
  },
  {
    "content": "cut it like this and I'll just cut all the way down so now I've got all those",
    "start": 611
  },
  {
    "content": "cut I will move on to the next phase and I'll show you that",
    "start": 620
  },
  {
    "content": "here have got a piece of fairly stiff cardboard it's no normal cardboard I'm",
    "start": 630
  },
  {
    "content": "gonna use my ruler and measure out a couple inches I want to use this to as",
    "start": 634
  },
  {
    "content": "guide marks okay so now I've got my pieces of brick what I'm going to use",
    "start": 642
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm going to use the white glue because the hot glue will dry too fast it won't",
    "start": 651
  },
  {
    "content": "give me the work time so I want a little bit of work time with this so I'm going",
    "start": 655
  },
  {
    "content": "to use the white glue and I'm just going to apply some down okay so I got that",
    "start": 659
  },
  {
    "content": "down now what I'm going to do is start putting down the bricks but I'm going to",
    "start": 665
  },
  {
    "content": "put them down with the half side up so I can see so I'll put that and then that",
    "start": 670
  },
  {
    "content": "and I'm not touching out a little bit of room between the bricks",
    "start": 681
  },
  {
    "content": "and see this helps the the half the half mark helps me to gauge where to lay the",
    "start": 692
  },
  {
    "content": "brick so there we go I've got that now I'll",
    "start": 697
  },
  {
    "content": "just start filling in so let me show you give you a little closer look at that",
    "start": 723
  },
  {
    "content": "see that now I'll start filling in so put a brick here on the edge",
    "start": 728
  },
  {
    "content": "it's like a jigsaw puzzle now I'm not going to fill in those end",
    "start": 747
  },
  {
    "content": "parts and remember this is an old cobblestone road so it doesn't have to",
    "start": 756
  },
  {
    "content": "be perfect if they're not quite perfect you know don't worry about it",
    "start": 762
  },
  {
    "content": "and I have some more bricks left so I'm going to go ahead and extend it a little",
    "start": 767
  },
  {
    "content": "further all right I'm happy with that I think",
    "start": 771
  },
  {
    "content": "that's good so they're taking a look at that so it looks like a brick wall",
    "start": 790
  },
  {
    "content": "almost so before I do any cutting on this to reduce the size of it for the",
    "start": 793
  },
  {
    "content": "stamp I'm gonna let this dry and then we will we'll prepare it for stamping",

  },
  {
    "content": "my brick pattern has dried and so it's all ready to go",
    "start": 815
  },
  {
    "content": "so what I'm going to do to make my stamp is I'm going to use a scissors and I'll",
    "start": 819
  },
  {
    "content": "just cut it so I'll cut up where the bricks end and then I'll cut on this",
    "start": 824
  },
  {
    "content": "side where the bricks end okay now so basically what I'm gonna do is use the",
    "start": 831
  },
  {
    "content": "stamp like this but to make it a little easier to use I want to cut a few pieces",
    "start": 837
  },
  {
    "content": "off here and I'm gonna kind of make a candle and this is something you",
    "start": 843
  },
  {
    "content": "wouldn't have to do but so I'm just kind of guesstimating",
    "start": 851
  },
  {
    "content": "so help give me a little bit of a hand along this thing so what I'm gonna do is",

  },
  {
    "content": "glue that on with my trusty glue gun I'll grab that",
    "start": 865
  },
  {
    "content": "okay so I've got a really nice Stamper there now so I can just pick this up",
    "start": 877
  },
  {
    "content": "stamp it down with that nice brick pattern and get those cobblestones on",
    "start": 882
  },
  {
    "content": "the road so now we'll pull up our road and I'll show you how to do that",
    "start": 888
  },
  {
    "content": "now for this part I want sections of the cobblestone to have appeared to have",
    "start": 900
  },
  {
    "content": "survived the ravages of time so I'm going to use my stamp that I made I'm",
    "start": 905
  },
  {
    "content": "gonna use a wide brush and I you don't necessarily have to brush the whole",
    "start": 913
  },
  {
    "content": "thing so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get got amount of paint on the brush and",
    "start": 916
  },
  {
    "content": "then just kind of like that so I'm not covering the whole thing and I'm also",
    "start": 920
  },
  {
    "content": "going to get some light some white or lighter gray and kinda get it on there",
    "start": 927
  },
  {
    "content": "so I can get a color variation and then I'll just stamp it and there we go I got",
    "start": 933

  {
    "content": "a nice cobblestone effect there so I'll just put some more paint on there and a",
    "start": 940
  },
  {
    "content": "little bit of light and you can kind of hit it a few times get some lighter ones",
    "start": 948
  },
  {
    "content": "on there all right so I'm happy with that grouping of of cobblestones now",
    "start": 958
  },
  {
    "content": "what I'm gonna do is I just wipe this off so just wipe off the excess paint",

    "content": "I'll let this dry and we'll start adding more detail",

    "content": "got my wrote section here in the bricks have dried up so I'm going to do is use",

  {
    "content": "a sponge this one has kind of a grill scrubbing pad on it and I'm going to use",
    "start": 986

    "content": "that to do the dirt so I'll just get my earth Brown and apply it to the the damp",
    "start": 992

  {
    "content": "sponge I've damp this already cover the sponge and then I'll start",
    "start": 1000
  },
  {
    "content": "stamping on now you want to kind of keep away from the areas that have the bricks",
    "start": 1010

  {
    "content": "and if you get you get some overlap that's that's quite all right all right",

  {
    "content": "so I got a nice dirt texture on there look at that",
    "start": 1035

  {
    "content": "okay so we'll let this dry and then we'll work on it some more data another",

  {
    "content": "layer of texture on this this road also has some gravel on it",
    "start": 1052

  },
  {
    "content": "those little scrubby sponges so it has like a little texture on it and I",
    "start": 1070

    "content": "thought that'd give a really nice rubble effect",

  {
    "content": "I'm just gonna start applying grey to it I'm generous",

    "content": "and you can kind of see the texture there let me grab my root section and",

  {
    "content": "you can see it's flattened out since it dried out so now I'll just start",

    "content": "stippling that on there that's giving a night really nice kind of gravelly look",

    "content": "to do one more step and then we'll be finished with the road",

    "content": "now what I'm going to do is take my sponge and just turn it on the other",
