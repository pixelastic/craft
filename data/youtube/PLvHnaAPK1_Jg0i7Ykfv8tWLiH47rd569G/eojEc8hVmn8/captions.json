    "content": "this on the stamp itself then line it up with the other pieces they're nice even",

    "content": "pressure and voila stamped so easy okay now here's the standard grid I've got",

  {
    "content": "three different colors here and you want to add these different colors to give",

  },

    "content": "variation so that's what's cool about this technique you know how to put any",

  },
  {
    "content": "kind of texture on these stamps the cork itself will do that for you",
    "start": 338
  },
  {
    "content": "alright so line it up nice even pressure and voila nice so easy and so quick cool",
    "start": 343
  },
  {
    "content": "all right now some of the lines can sometimes when you stamp what we as",
    "start": 363
  },
  {
    "content": "pronounced as you want like that centerline so I'm going to just paint on",
    "start": 367
  },
  {
    "content": "here with some water down black and see that just fixes that right up so any of",
    "start": 371
  },
  {
    "content": "these tiles that you have a problem with like that you can just paint little bit",
    "start": 375
  },
  {
    "content": "of black in there and fix the problem now I'm going to use a smaller brush",
    "start": 379
  },
  {
    "content": "upsets a little bit there and put some cracks in these just some more detail",

  },

    "content": "and you can do anything like this on these tiles they take paint really",

  },
  {
    "content": "really well alright sweet looking good so here's another one I did it's the",
    "start": 391

  {
    "content": "sandstone one there's a little some muddy areas on there so I'm going to",

  {
    "content": "kind of fill those in with some black just to kind of make the the details pop",

  {
    "content": "out and like I say you can do this with any stamps if you over stamped a little",

  },
  {
    "content": "bit you can fix it very easily like this so easy easy so that looks really good",
    "start": 413
  },
  {
    "content": "and even doing this the work you know the work to do this is very little you",

    "content": "know a lot less than actually doing it with in foam core the whole thing out of",

  },
  {
    "content": "foam core or something just stamping it so easy here I'm just pronouncing these",

  {
    "content": "lines because I put some highlights on the tile with the light gray and some of",

  },
  {
    "content": "it got in the cracks I'm fixing that so just nice you can have so many",
    "start": 441

    "content": "variations cobblestone and wood just great here is different even different",

    "content": "designs on just a standard 1 by 1 squares just makes it so much different",

  {
    "content": "okay one is since they're made from the cork and they're soaked in glue they're",

  },
  {
    "content": "stiff you're not going to have the wobbling the bending and that kind of",

    "content": "thing to put on the table it's going to be all bent up so that takes care of",

  {
    "content": "that problem with the with the glue on the cork now",
    "start": 499
  },
  {
    "content": "another thing is the texture built into the cork itself so when you stamp you",

  },
  {
    "content": "don't have to put texture actually on the stand you just make the design and",
    "start": 509
  },
  {
    "content": "when you stamp it it makes these very individual because there's different",

  },
  {
    "content": "texture on these cork tiles and it makes it so it has a lot of nice nice texture",
    "start": 516

  {
    "content": "also they're double-sided so unlike unlike traditional 2.5 D you can do it",

  {
    "content": "on both sides you can have a different design of both sides and get double duty",

  {
    "content": "match and that kind of thing these tiles these this court actually takes paint",

  {
    "content": "very well so I don't have to worry about the paint coming off or anything like",
    "start": 558
