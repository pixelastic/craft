  {
    "content": "these in okay so wet my brush get it quite wet and I'm using the the grey on",

  {
    "content": "at first okay and then I use a little bit of burnt sienna and some tan to give",

  {
    "content": "it some color variation alright and now I'll just do the same with the other",

    "content": "to add some extra strength of these so I'm going to turn it over and then use a",

  {
    "content": "is a light kind of light gray like gray tan that was kind just dry brush that",

  },
  {
    "content": "and that really pull out that detail and make it",
    "start": 283
  },
  {
    "content": "look like rock so there we go and then I want to do another color of a country",
    "start": 286
  },
  {
    "content": "gray this is a lighter gray so it's just a highlight and just add a little bit of",

  },
  {
    "content": "like a false cliff face and put it on the front of where the camper would be",

  },
  {
    "content": "yeah so that was just really simply constructed I'll show you guys that in a",

  {
    "content": "later video and so we can remove that and you could also put other things to",

  },
  {
    "content": "those too to mark the entrance all right so you wouldn't even need to make that",
    "start": 357
  },
  {
    "content": "one piece and those look really great you could also do something else so",
    "start": 361
  },
  {
    "content": "let's remove those and I had some pillars I hads they were just have some",
    "start": 370
  },
  {
    "content": "cheap toy pillars I've handed up and you can use those to mark the entrance like",

  {
    "content": "it was an old civilization that had carved out the cave or something and had",
    "start": 379
  },
  {
    "content": "pillars at the front so yeah you could you could mark the entrance with any",

    "content": "number of things like this and so here I'll just go into the to the cavern",
    "start": 387

    "content": "itself I remove the walls which I would do in play because you don't want them",
    "start": 393

  {
    "content": "cavern pieces I've got my characters have moved in and I grab a wall out of",

  {
    "content": "the tote there and the great thing about this is unlike a tile you can only you",

  },
  {
    "content": "could put down only as much as characters can cease up them a low light",
    "start": 414

  },
  {
    "content": "entrance left that way put a couple of those stone pillars there then we can",
    "start": 425
  },
  {
    "content": "expand the cave so when they move in they see more and also when they move in",
    "start": 433
  },
  {
    "content": "and see more you can start laying down terrain so here's some stalagmites I",
    "start": 438
  },
  {
    "content": "made and here's a bit another piece down to enlarge the cave there sorry it's at",
    "start": 442

  {
    "content": "videos some more stalagmites and so there we go",

  },
  {
    "content": "so you know you show them what they see right so they can be looking around the",
    "start": 464
  },
  {
    "content": "cave maybe they're trying to find stuff but when you put this terrain down it's",
    "start": 469
  },
  {
    "content": "great because you're only revealing what they see and then you can also reveal to",
    "start": 474

  {
    "content": "monsters so the monster comes out from a certain piece of terrain as they get",
    "start": 480

    "start": 485

  {
    "content": "they all move out and you can have a battle going and yeah so we'll move this",
    "start": 490
  },
  {
    "content": "out of the way and we'll kind of move the cavern down and generally what I do",
    "start": 497

  {
    "content": "is I have the players map out even when I'm playing with tiles I have the",
    "start": 502
  },
  {
    "content": "players map out so you can just have the players one player be a mapper and map",

  {
    "content": "out the you know it's it don't have to be a great map just rough map of the",
    "start": 511
  },
  {
    "content": "cavern or the dungeon and then that way you can just keep reusing the pieces",
    "start": 515
  },
  {
    "content": "right so here I'll move the remove the creatures and we'll do some more",
    "start": 522
  },
  {
    "content": "configurations here and you can turn them either way so you could have the",
    "start": 528
  },
  {
    "content": "pieces going one way or the other which is really cool so I'm going to have a",
    "start": 532
  },
  {
    "content": "passage leading off so I'll just put that one there and then put another",
    "start": 538
  },
  {
    "content": "there and that's a great way to show a passage leading off and then you can",
    "start": 542
  },
  {
    "content": "just expand into more you could have as many as you wanted and",
    "start": 546
  },
  {
    "content": "like I say this is really great this you can just give me all on the fly you can",
    "start": 552

  {
    "content": "just be making this up as you go along which is really what's nice about this",
    "start": 557
  },
  {
    "content": "system but it still gives you a nice defined play area as far as the 2.5 D",
    "start": 561
  },
  {
    "content": "and I like that so let's put some more stuff down here's some rubble I made so",
    "start": 566
  },
  {
    "content": "these are all just things that I put on a tile just I base them on cardstock so",
    "start": 570
  },
  {
    "content": "I could lay them down now here's a subterranean entrance so you know that",
    "start": 575
  },
  {
    "content": "can be going to another cavern you could have monsters come out of that",
    "start": 580
  },
  {
    "content": "so that's a nice good reveal that when they get close enough here's a little",
    "start": 583
  },
  {
    "content": "pool so that's kind of cool so yeah it's just the same as a regular tile you're",
    "start": 588
  },
  {
    "content": "just laying individual pieces and there's some more stalagmites I made so",
    "start": 593

  {
    "content": "yeah I got a nice play area there and yeah it's just it's very similar to the",
    "start": 599

  {
    "content": "tile base it does take a little longer to set up than a tile but it gives you a",
    "start": 605
  },
  {
    "content": "lot more variety so here is a some pillars stone pillars and you know you",
    "start": 610
  },
  {
    "content": "could use those in the cave that creatures come out from behind them that",
    "start": 618
