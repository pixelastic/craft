    "content": "so very cool very cool I then just mixed Elmer's glue-all and",
    "start": 315
  },
  {
    "content": "black acrylic paint and painted it on so this will do two things this will harden",

  {
    "content": "you use it as a clip it won't easily Bend or you know rip or anything like",

    "content": "that so I painted these up exactly like I did",

  {
    "content": "the tiles to check out build one for that also what I did though is I painted",

  {
    "content": "the pieces that are the clips I just painted like a metal plate that kind of",
