  },
  {
    "content": "standard way to play this game is with index cards okay and let me explain that",
    "start": 132
  },
  {
    "content": "for a second okay so it's called index card role-playing game RPG and what that",

  },
  {
    "content": "means is you lay out cards index cards and they have might have certain things",

  },
  {
    "content": "give them you know a little bit of an advantage for that but the the reason",
    "start": 169
  },
  {
    "content": "that's so great is because the cards remind you of what's in the room right",
    "start": 175
  },
  {
    "content": "if you describe what's in the room theater of the mind it's easy to forget",

  },
  {
    "content": "you could do theater of the mind you can do terrain or anything anything like",

  },

    "content": "done which work very well or you could do full terrain which I've also done so",
    "start": 217

  {
    "content": "type of play and so it's it's very versatile now about the rules the rules",

  {
    "content": "are basically d20 based right and if you played D&D or any other d20 game you",

  {
    "content": "have to learn this whole you know rule set and all this kind of",

  },

  {
    "content": "this monster having a hit an armor class and this thing having a target number",

  },
  {
    "content": "encounter okay that's the armor class of the enemies that's the difficulty of all",
    "start": 283
  },
  {
    "content": "the checks everything so what you what I do is I've kind of put a Big D 20 out",
    "start": 288
  },
  {
    "content": "and then which is kind of the way that the game is played meant to be played",
    "start": 294

    "content": "you put a big D 20 out and then people can know what the target is",

    "content": "automatically a never have to ask you what the target of the room is because",
    "start": 303
  },
  {
    "content": "it's always the same so that speeds play immensely it's it's so great and then",
    "start": 306
  },
  {
    "content": "what you could do is you can ratchet up the difficulty as they get further and",
    "start": 312
  },
  {
    "content": "further or you know in more dangerous areas you know going from you know a",
    "start": 315
  },
  {
    "content": "difficulty of a 10 you need a 10 for everything to 11 to 12 to 13 or 14 or",

  },
  {
    "content": "higher that those few pips really make the difficulty ramped up okay so that's",
    "start": 324
  },
  {
    "content": "a great aspect of this system that's one thing that speeds up play another thing",
    "start": 332
  },
  {
    "content": "I really like the speeds up play is is enemies have well you also and enemies",
    "start": 337
  },
  {
    "content": "have hearts and a heart is ten hit points okay so care all characters start",
    "start": 343

    "content": "are the same way so they you have they have ten hit points you do do if I'm",
    "start": 352
  },
  {
    "content": "wants there has two hearts you know it has 20 hit points it's that simple",
    "start": 356
  },
  {
    "content": "so it makes it really easy on the fly to come up with monsters or that kind of",
    "start": 359
  },
  {
    "content": "thing or whatever you need to you need to do because you know you know like",

  {
    "content": "have 20 or 30 you know or 30 that's it there's nothing more to it and so you",

  {
    "content": "know it's it's really easy to make up monsters on the fly",
    "start": 383
  },

    "content": "like oh I need some enemies okay they would have 20 hit points over that 10",
    "start": 387

  {
    "content": "hit points or whatever so it that makes it super simple you know to to add your",

  {
    "content": "own monsters to the game on the fly another interesting aspect of the game",
    "start": 395

    "content": "you got yeah you got to get it going right and so I really that's that's a",
    "start": 555
  },
  {
    "content": "really cool part of the game now I I don't always use the timer okay I like",
    "start": 560
