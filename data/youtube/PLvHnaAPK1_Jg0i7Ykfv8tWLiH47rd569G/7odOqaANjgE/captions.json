  {
    "content": "what I mean when I cut these up so I'm going to go ahead and paint these next",

  {
    "content": "step before I cut them so I'll just I'll do that now",

  },
  {
    "content": "so my hot glue is dried enough to do the next part so I'm going to get the get my",

  },
  {
    "content": "brush grab the same blue that I used for the fountain very light blue and I'll do",

  },
  {
    "content": "you're not really going to see it I will put a little bit of white though there",

  },
  {
    "content": "she'll not lose it too much from my back all right",
