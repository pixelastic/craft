  {
    "content": "gelatinous look all right see if you can see that all",

  },

  {
    "content": "ready to go so you can see the texture I got on there came out really nicely so",

    "content": "sides over and I'm trying to make a rough cube and these are just two by two",

  },
  {
    "content": "just use my hot glue get that edge and remember you don't have to be perfect",

  {
    "content": "with this this is just and then just hold it until it bonds and now we'll",

    "content": "work our way around and do all the edges like this and I'll come back and show",

  {
    "content": "to add a little more detail first and strength so what I'm gonna do is use my",

    "start": 439
  },
  {
    "content": "grab our glue gun and we'll start kind of messing with those edges so what I'll",

  },
  {
    "content": "do is I'll just drag the blue gun over the edge and it'll kind of blend it into",
    "start": 449

  {
    "content": "the rest and this will give it a not so perfectly square shape so to look more",

  {
    "content": "gelatinous and less plasticky okay so I'm going to run over all the edges like",

  {
    "content": "that and then we'll be done and I'll show you what it looks like on the tile",
