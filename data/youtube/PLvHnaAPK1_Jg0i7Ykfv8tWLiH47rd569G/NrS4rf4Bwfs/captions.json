    "content": "those plates just kind of like what I did for these segments on the front once",

    "content": "clay there for each segment and make sure that it's defined that it looks",

    "content": "doing that middle crest I put some kind of lines into the carapace to give a",

  {
    "content": "that's that hard as I mentioned I lost some footage so let's draw here what I",

  {
    "content": "do with the mouth so on the inside of the mouth i sculpted this kind of pucker",

    "content": "like protrusion for the gullet had folds of skin coming out from the center and",

    "content": "to show you what I did so those are connected to that Center gullet there",

    "content": "and then I did segments within those so just kind of like I did the back scales",
