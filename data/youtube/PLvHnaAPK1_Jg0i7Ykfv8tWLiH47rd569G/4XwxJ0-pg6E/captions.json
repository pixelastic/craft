  },
  {
    "content": "gonna add some glue on there and just that'll just soak in there and once this",
    "start": 277
  },
  {
    "content": "dries it'll harden up just like the rock this is such an easy technique to do and",

    "content": "the paper mache and all that kind of stuff all right here is my rock and it",

  {
    "content": "is hard but I'm also going to reinforce it a little bit with some extra white",
    "start": 299
  },
  {
    "content": "glue so I'll just put that on full strength and what I'll do is let's use a",

  },
  {
    "content": "brush with a little bit of water on it and just spread it out over the surface",
    "start": 307
  },
  {
    "content": "and that'll help make the surface extra hard so yeah this is just such a simple",
    "start": 311
  },
  {
    "content": "way to make paper mache and what I like is you know the paper towels and toilet",
    "start": 316
  },
  {
    "content": "paper give you much more texture than like you know newspaper right so here is",
    "start": 321

  {
    "content": "a double select night I did and it's just the same as I did the other one the",

  },
  {
    "content": "single one I just added a smaller one to the larger base and just paint the glue",
    "start": 332
  },
  {
    "content": "on there just like I did with the rock and this will just harden it you know",

  },
  {
    "content": "harden it up and make it extra strong for your games",
    "start": 340
  },
  {
    "content": "so yeah wait till we get these painted up they're gonna look great and yeah",
    "start": 342
  },
  {
    "content": "that's just such an easy simple technique you know as far as the paper",
    "start": 348
  },
  {
    "content": "mache goes so I got a bunch of these finished and I just let them dry on a",
    "start": 353
  },
  {
    "content": "plastic cutting board and that's perfect cuz they'll just pop right off of there",
    "start": 358
  },
  {
    "content": "when they're dry so yeah these are all the different shapes I came up with so",
    "start": 361
  },
  {
    "content": "yeah just super easy to do and this was just a short period of time to do all",
    "start": 364
  },
  {
    "content": "this alright so here we go this is hardened I want to add a little more",
    "start": 368
  },
  {
    "content": "detail to it I'm going to use this and this is a regular sand so it has",
    "start": 373

  {
    "content": "different sized aggregate and it means it's not play sand where it's all smooth",
    "start": 377
  },
  {
    "content": "it has different sized pebbles and that kind of thing in it so I'm just gonna",
    "start": 380
  },
  {
    "content": "put some glue and I'm not covering the whole thing just a little spots on the",
    "start": 383
  },
  {
    "content": "rock there and then I'll just cover it with this sand",
    "start": 386
  },
  {
    "content": "I call it construction sand but it's I think it's called standard sand so let's",
    "start": 389
  },
  {
    "content": "cover that up and let it dry and now does this dry you can see that you know",
    "start": 395
  },
  {
    "content": "certain areas the rock have that like irregular",

  },
  {
    "content": "texture on it so that's a really nice effect there and just super easy and",

  },
  {
    "content": "cheap one of these bags will last you for your crafting life right or you can",
    "start": 406
  },
  {
    "content": "just get sand outside so here this here's the stalagtite and I'm just",
    "start": 409
  },
  {
    "content": "putting some on the base so yeah there we go and here they are",
    "start": 415
  },
  {
    "content": "it's all dried so yeah just really nice then we'll paint those up",
    "start": 422
  },
  {
    "content": "now that we're all sprayed black or you could paint it black with the black",
    "start": 426
  },
  {
    "content": "acrylic paint I'm gonna use some different colors gray burnt sienna and a",
    "start": 430
  },
  {
    "content": "tan okay and I'm just gonna get the gray on there for it some dapple some burnt",
    "start": 435
  },
  {
    "content": "sienna on there and then some tan and see that kind of muddiness on there",
    "start": 441
  },
  {
    "content": "really gives like the colors of a rock you know you don't just want gray you",
    "start": 445
  },
  {
    "content": "want kind of a mix of colors that are in a natural rock and I think that really",
    "start": 450
  },
  {
    "content": "does a great job on that so same with the stalagmites or stalactites I guess",
    "start": 454
  },
  {
    "content": "depending where we're in the cave they are right",
    "start": 460
  },
  {
    "content": "so yeah just paint those up same way at the gray and then get some burnt sienna",
    "start": 463
  },
  {
    "content": "and some tan and see how nice and muddy that is really looks like kind of",
    "start": 468
  },
  {
    "content": "natural rock there and then we'll just let that dry up and move on to our last",
    "start": 476
  },
  {
    "content": "step now we really want to bring that detail out right now this is dried and",
    "start": 480
  },
  {
    "content": "he's a dry brush technique which is just light gray and just get a little bit of",
    "start": 486
  },
  {
    "content": "it on the brush and just kind of flick it on the surface and see how all that",
    "start": 490
  },
  {
    "content": "texture comes out all that toilet paper that we scrunched up comes out and looks",
    "start": 494
  },
  {
    "content": "like folds in the rock and that kind of thing as well as a sand on there right",
    "start": 498
  },
  {
    "content": "so it looks so great and see all that detail popping out just really awesome",
    "start": 502
  },
  {
    "content": "and so just keep dry brushing that on there to get all that detail popping out",
    "start": 508
  },
  {
    "content": "and last one here the double one here so yeah just it's just a really easy",
    "start": 514
  },
  {
    "content": "technique you just flick it on there and see all that detail popping out how we",
    "start": 522
  },
  {
    "content": "twisted that toilet paper really looks like selec mites right cool",
    "start": 526
  },
  {
    "content": "alright last step for our very last step we're gonna use a wash and this is just",
    "start": 533
  },
  {
    "content": "black acrylic paint a little bit of soap and water right and you want to fit it",
    "start": 538
  },
  {
    "content": "down quite a bit I'm just going to paint it on here and",
    "start": 542
  },
  {
    "content": "see it's very wet it just runs like water and what that's going to do is",
    "start": 545
  },
  {
    "content": "bring out all those and dents into the piece right and will",
    "start": 549
  },
  {
    "content": "do with the slag might also but yeah it's kind of the opposite of the dry",
    "start": 553
  },
  {
    "content": "brush right the dry brush brings out the highlights but the wash brings out the",
    "start": 557
  },
  {
    "content": "recession's right so there we go we'll let that dry up and then we'll show you",
    "start": 561
  },
  {
    "content": "what it looks like here all my pieces wash and you can see it really adds that",
    "start": 566
  },
  {
    "content": "last extra touch to these pieces it really brings out the the shadows in",
    "start": 570
  },
  {
    "content": "these and really gives them a three-dimensional effect",
    "start": 575
  },
  {
    "content": "hey friends I want to talk a little bit about the downside of this right there",
    "start": 579
  },
  {
    "content": "really the downside is only the waiting for it to dry okay sometimes you a lot",
    "start": 583
  },
  {
    "content": "want it now and it's really hard to wait for that but there are some things you",
    "start": 588
  },
  {
    "content": "can do to speed up the drying process right and here's a few things I found",
    "start": 591
  },
  {
    "content": "that work really well one is just a simple fan right just put it in front of",
    "start": 595
  },
  {
    "content": "a fan that speeds up the drying process considerably right another thing is the",
    "start": 600
  },
  {
    "content": "winner and the winner put it in front of a heating vent",
    "start": 604

  {
    "content": "the drying process for the the paper mache pieces too so there are several",

  {
    "content": "ways you can do to speed it up you could also put it into an oven I don't",
    "start": 622
  },
  {
    "content": "recommend that because you could forget about it you know you'd leave it in",
    "start": 628

  {
    "content": "there too long that kind of thing in a car the temperatures get higher but",

  {
    "content": "they're not gonna get high enough that you have to worry about you can just",
    "start": 636

    "content": "pay attention to it know that kind of thing so I would be careful with using",

    "content": "it up and that's a possibility on a very low low low low setting that's a",

  {
    "content": "possibility too but I wouldn't recommend that I do either a fan method the car",
