    "content": "bit of a different technique and this is the foam okay and the court tends to",

    "content": "kind of cut it out cut into the foam you want those nice deep gouges so really",

  {
    "content": "help you get to define stamp you're looking for then I'm going to just kind",

  {
    "content": "of drag that pen through it'll kind of widen those cuts right and the ends I'm",

    "content": "going to kind of spread them out a little bit and take the back off be",

  {
    "content": "wood I'm just doing a brown on this because I'm going to do a kind of an",

    "content": "think to this stuff gives like a nice highlight on that",

  },
  {
    "content": "very cool here you go I've got the last stamp there just do that highlighting",
    "start": 467

  {
    "content": "yeah I've kind of put the highlight on it and then I started doing this and I",

  {
    "content": "really like to define kind of highlight on there so I started doing this",

  {
    "content": "okay here's you know you can do difference this is a two by six and I",

  {
    "content": "kind of turn the stamp so it's not all going the same way and you saw I did",

  {
    "content": "and then you know the other side is the wood texture so I do this tunnel one and",

  {
    "content": "the wood on the other you can build out a wooden structure you know and there we",

  {
    "content": "go very cool I hope you found this episode informative and helpful when",
