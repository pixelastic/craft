  {
    "content": "okay now so I hope you can see that as an edging around it so that kind of ads",

    "content": "ready to go to the next step so here you can see I've got both wheels",

    "content": "that would be like this and there we go alright so now that bridge is a little",

    "content": "plain so what I'm going to do is I'm going to put some banding on it to make",

  },
  {
    "content": "it look like a sturdy more sturdy structure so I'll do that now",
    "start": 623

  {
    "content": "so here we go I've just cut some half inch strips these are just cardstock I'm",
    "start": 632
  },
  {
    "content": "gonna use that for the banding now what I'm going to do is I've got a smaller",
    "start": 640
  },
  {
    "content": "strip for here because I want to cover up this piece here so I'm gonna glue",
    "start": 644
  },
  {
    "content": "that on might get some strings with your glue gun there so now I'm gonna put nuts",

  {
    "content": "more banding off now do that put one at the end of the bridge put",

    "content": "going to be standing up you're going to see the other side so what I'm going to",

    "content": "I wouldn't do this never put any detail where you're not going to see but this",
