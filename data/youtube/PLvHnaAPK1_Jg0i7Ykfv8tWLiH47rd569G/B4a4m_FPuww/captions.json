  {
    "content": "move on to the painting alright in the painting department I've got several",

  {
    "content": "the tiles is a stone texture okay this stuff is is fairly expensive it's about",

    "content": "I do have a video later on where I show a sponge technique they can replace this",

  {
    "content": "just super quick and as you see that as I talked about in the video you see how",

    "content": "if you don't want to this but this makes for a quick tile now the reason I use",

  {
    "content": "this you're going to be spending a lot of money because this stuff is expensive",

    "content": "so what I do is I paint my tiles black first with this and that that covers",

    "content": "most the tile and then I then I hit it a little bit with this just enough to give",

    "content": "it a stone texture that way you don't have to spray and spray and spray and",

  },
  {
    "content": "I'll cut along here okay and I'm going to cut these out in strips all right so",

  {
    "content": "now one important thing though when you cut these strips okay there's two sides",

  {
    "content": "to the cardboard one is the corrugation the wavy part and the other is the non",

    "content": "have that strength built right into the wall itself so now I'll cut these out",

  {
    "content": "alright so what I will do is I will take a strip okay oh one last thing I want to",

  },
  {
    "content": "talk about too is generally cardboard has two sides one is kind of a smoother",

    "content": "if you're hand painting it can really make a difference just a little side",

    "content": "note there okay so now we get our tile and now let's add some walls to this so",

  {
    "content": "what we can do is we can either apply glue hot glue to the strip or to the",

  {
    "content": "little short so I'll save this for another part but then I'll just grab",

  {
    "content": "that hot glue works really quickly one little trick I like to do too is where",

  {
    "content": "the corner joints come together I like to put a little bit of hot glue on there",

  {
    "content": "is where it can get a bit tricky okay so you want to think about it before you",
    "start": 1593
  },
  {
    "content": "just go slap its up down okay because you're going to have the wall coming",

    "content": "this wall connects or you can make it like this and this wall connects okay",

    "content": "piece of a wall you're going to use and kind of mark where how far it comes so",

    "content": "simple task of just grabbing the sand in a small cup or whatever you have and",

    "content": "just do this now I can save that for another another use alright so now you",

    "content": "can use a little brush and any loose pieces you can also help get some of the",

    "content": "use the black I'm gonna use some black acrylic a medium brush I'm gonna get a",

    "content": "to be safe you could you could do it sooner than that but what I like to do",

    "content": "is you know for you know I always think about workflow when I'm making this kind",

  {
    "content": "project to dry now you can also kind of pull out from the rubble itself to kind",

  {
    "content": "of give like a little maybe it fell from the ceiling or you know whatever",

  {
    "content": "we'll let these dry and come back for the next step my rubble piles are dry",
