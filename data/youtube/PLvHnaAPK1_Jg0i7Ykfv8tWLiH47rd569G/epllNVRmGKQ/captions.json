    "content": "brown so I'm gonna I got on my paint and I'm gonna use a bristly brush to kind of",

  },
  {
    "content": "give it that spotted texture so I'll just jab that into the paint kind of",

  {
    "content": "to pulling across because there's no texture to hold on to so I'm just gonna",

    "content": "that the paint will darken a little bit as it dry so every time you see when I",

    "content": "the corpse tokens you want to have a nice little marker but you don't want",

  },
  {
    "content": "them to be too obstructive to play you want figures they'll to still stand on",

  },
  {
    "content": "them so the solution I came up with was to use my liquitex flexible modeling",
    "start": 399
  },
  {
    "content": "paste what I'm going to do is I'll open that and then I'm just going to use my",

  },
  {
    "content": "this little sculpting tool that I've used quite often just a cheap little",

  },

    "content": "tool that I got at the craft store so I'm going to grab a glob",

    "content": "out of the flexible modeling paste jar and I'll just plop it on there and",
    "start": 423
  },
  {
    "content": "that's not much I'm gonna grab some that off and then I'm just gonna kind of",
    "start": 434
  },
  {
    "content": "splatter it around the now one thing you can also do is a lot",
    "start": 444
  },
  {
    "content": "of times if the flexible model pet lot of modeling paste will dry a little bit",
    "start": 453
  },
  {
    "content": "at the top so you can get like kind of crusted little pieces just to get in",
    "start": 457
  },
  {
    "content": "there alright so we got that so you just do as many of these as you want and",
    "start": 464
  },
  {
    "content": "there's you know enough texture on here to give it some interest but not to make",

  {
    "content": "it too impossible to stand on or actually just to stack on top of each",

  {
    "content": "doorway or something they just keep piling up so kind of get a little",

  },
  {
    "content": "gruesome there but hey we're not playing Mario Brothers all right",
    "start": 500
  },
  {
    "content": "there we go I will let this dry and it will come back and we'll add the paint",

    "content": "detail to it here's my dried disc the modeling paces",

  {
    "content": "this is a cherry red and they owns a fire engine red so I'll go ahead and",

  {
    "content": "start painting those alright you got that so now I'm gonna put a little highl",
    "start": 538
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm gonna go ahead and put it on while it's wet so I'll just get to grab some",
    "start": 549

  {
    "content": "that lighter red and just kind of alright so here we go now I'll move on",

  {
    "content": "to the next step now you can see our token looks pretty",

    "content": "I'm going to do to give it that is use some water-based varnish and this stuff",

  {
    "content": "brush in won't be able to see this off-camera and all I do is just pop it",

    "content": "here's our first battle setup and before we get started I wanted to give you a",

  },
  {
    "content": "little close-up of the gore token so it came out really nice there and the nice",
    "start": 643
  },
  {
    "content": "thing is it has a washer on the bottom so they won't slide around or move much",
    "start": 648
  },
  {
    "content": "so what we do is you have our pile near the board and it's kind of nice you can",

  },
  {
    "content": "designate a player as the Corpse master and they can lay the tokens down as you",

  {
    "content": "come around a corner and they get attacked by three enemies so we got a",

  {
    "content": "combat going on there and through skill and luck our adventurers managed to kill",
    "start": 678
  },

    "content": "one so we remove that one place the gore token there and then they kill another",
    "start": 684
  },
  {
    "content": "one place the gore token there and then I kill that one and place the gore token",
    "start": 690

  {
    "content": "there so now before they move up they another another round of guys come",
    "start": 696
  },
  {
    "content": "running in from hearing the noise so depending on initiative and everything",
    "start": 706

  {
    "content": "problem the guys can can stamp pretty easily stand on this stuff so it's not a",
    "start": 719
  },
  {
    "content": "problem so say they fighting again and this one dies you could just stack",
    "start": 724
  },
  {
    "content": "another one right on there say this one dies you can just stack another one on",
    "start": 731

    "content": "there and say this sometimes you get stack another one on there and so on and",
    "start": 736
  },
  {
    "content": "if they start to get 2 foot fold you could just kind of make the pile you",

    "content": "somebody lay down and try to get past them and see how",
