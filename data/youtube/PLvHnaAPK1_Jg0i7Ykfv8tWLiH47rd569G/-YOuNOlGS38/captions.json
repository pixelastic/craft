  {
    "content": "there okay you want to hold that for a minute so the glue dries so looking good",

  },
  {
    "content": "there okay so now what I want to do is you got to decide a couple things one is",

  {
    "content": "do you want to have the base flush with the rock or do you'll have a little",

    "content": "with the pen I'd be a little harder to see because it's a standard pen and not",

  {
    "content": "all right so that'll be kind of the base all right",
    "start": 358
  },
  {
    "content": "and like I said you could draw that right right on there flush so I'm going",
    "start": 361

    "content": "to what I'll do is I'll cut that out and then we'll come to move to the next step",

  {
    "content": "so here I've cut it out and I'm not going to put hot glue on the rock",

  {
    "content": "because I wouldn't like that nice texture I got from that toilet paper",

    "content": "there but I'm going to kind of blend the edge a little bit into the base so get",

  },
  {
    "content": "my hot glue and I will go on the edge of the rock just kind of blend that in just",
    "start": 382
  },
  {
    "content": "a bit okay so now I'll just go around the whole thing and do that finish that",
    "start": 391
  },
  {
    "content": "up so I want to add a little more to this",
    "start": 399
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm going to use my white glue okay my PVA glue and I'm going to add some piles",
    "start": 407

  {
    "content": "of glue here and these will be for some from sand I'll just kind of bring the",

  },
  {
    "content": "rock with that and you can even put a little bit on on there if you want okay",
    "start": 420
  },
  {
    "content": "so now I'll just grab my construction sand and just start pouring it on there",
    "start": 428

    "content": "so now let this dry and then I'll go paint it and we'll come back for the",

  {
    "content": "next step so here's the rock wall painted black",
    "start": 443

    "content": "looks really nice so to finish it up I'm going to give it a bit of a wash I'm",

    "content": "wet and just kind of blend that in and then I'll give a some interesting",
