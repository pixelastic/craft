  {
    "content": "that's coming up pop it off there little string up now I'll just continue around",

  {
    "content": "that is now you can see I've got a few strings still attached from the glue gun",
    "start": 617

    "content": "that you would measure from one inch so if you wanted to move over towards this",

    "content": "you know that'd be an inch sorry that'd be an inch that'd be another inch in",

  {
    "content": "looks really great just really practical and easy you can make a bunch of these",

    "content": "what you could have is just have this out pick it up and have it out of the",

  {
    "content": "if they see it then you could plop it down there like whoa you know in this",
    "start": 771
  },
  {
    "content": "and then that's an not only they have to avoid in the",
    "start": 774
  },
  {
    "content": "battle but it also may move around after somebody that's in within range so it's",
    "start": 777

  {
    "content": "a nice little hazard to have on the table and as you can see pretty easily",
