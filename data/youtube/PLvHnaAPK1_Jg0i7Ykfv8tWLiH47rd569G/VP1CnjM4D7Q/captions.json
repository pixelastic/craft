  {

  },
  {
    "content": "there that we put in with the glue gun so this gives a nice base for the red",

    "content": "and now I'm not going to just I'm not gonna wait for this to dry I'm just",

  },
  {
    "content": "gonna start adding the lighter red just right in there so it kind of mixed",
    "start": 543
  },
  {
    "content": "together all right so there we go so I'll let that dry up",
    "start": 570
  },
  {
    "content": "and then I'm going to paint some texture on this tile",
    "start": 577
  },
  {
    "content": "so as you can see the red has dried somewhat and you can see different",

  },
  {
    "content": "variations in the in the color from the lighter and darker red so what I'm going",
    "start": 596
  },
  {
    "content": "to do is I want to do this stone texture but I want to kind of do it like maybe a",
    "start": 601
  },
  {
    "content": "different little bit of a different shade so I'm going to do the technique",
    "start": 606
  },
  {
    "content": "with the sponge and I'm going to use a blue gray color so now I'll start",
    "start": 609
  },
  {
    "content": "applying that you can see how that gives a really neat effect okay so now what",
    "start": 615
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm going to do is I will add some more color to my sponge and then I'll do the",
    "start": 638
  },
  {
    "content": "outer edges so here we go with the outer edges look",
    "start": 641
  },
  {
    "content": "how awesome that looks really neat effect I kind of like that darker how it",
    "start": 653
  },
  {
    "content": "is I think what I'm gonna do is I will do I'll leave it I won't add a lighter",
    "start": 688
  },
  {
    "content": "stone texture on the top but I'll pick out the edges to make them really stand",
    "start": 694
  },
  {
    "content": "out so let's let that dry and then we'll move on to that step yeah look at that",
    "start": 699
  },
  {
    "content": "good so keeping in line with the kind of the",
    "start": 708
  },
  {
    "content": "flavor of this piece I'm going to use a bluish color that's called Caribbean",
    "start": 720
  },
  {
    "content": "it's kind of a turquoise so I'll get my chisel brush and I'll pick that out and",
    "start": 726
  },
  {
    "content": "then I'll just start picking out the edges so that'll reinforce that kind of",
    "start": 732
  },
  {
    "content": "blue now just go along all the edges alright so I got all the edges picked",
    "start": 744
  },
  {
    "content": "out looks really cool now what I'm going to do is I'm going to add some more",
    "start": 759
  },
  {
    "content": "detail so we'll let this dry for a second and then we'll move on to that",
    "start": 766
  },
  {
    "content": "so here we are and I've got I want to do some separate stones on this and I drew",
    "start": 776
  },
  {
    "content": "them on I drew the stones on with a sharpie but I want to differentiate",
    "start": 781
  },
  {
    "content": "those even a little better so I'm going to use a fairly thin brush and get some",
    "start": 784
  },
  {
    "content": "black paint and wet it quite a bit and then I'm going to just pull the brush on",
    "start": 789
  },
  {
    "content": "those like that fairly wide and then I'll do all the sides so there we go",
    "start": 799
  },
  {
    "content": "I've got that so I'm gonna let that dry and then do some more detail",
    "start": 822
  },
  {
    "content": "so now what I'm doing is I'm W well now what I'm doing is I'm gonna use this",
    "start": 834
  },
  {
    "content": "bristly brush and I'm going to kind of fill in the black gap there so I'll get",
    "start": 838
  },
  {
    "content": "the that blue that I used to do the highlight and I'm kind of kind of start",
    "start": 843
  },
  {
    "content": "on the edge there so I'm filling in some of the black but I'm still leaving and",
    "start": 848
  },
  {
    "content": "that looks pretty blue right now but that'll that'll dry a darker color so",
    "start": 861
  },
  {
    "content": "now move on to the others all right so now we'll finish this up",
    "start": 866
  },
  {
    "content": "so now those are dry if you have any ones that still then maybe a little too",
    "start": 895
  },
  {
    "content": "much you can always go back over with the black and kind of do a thinner line",
    "start": 901
  },
  {
    "content": "on it you can also do some damage to this don't work so you could go you know",
    "start": 904
  },
  {
    "content": "kind of some little cracks or crevices on the edge and it's just a very light",
    "start": 912
  },
  {
    "content": "touch just slowly drag the brush over you can also pull some black from the",
    "start": 929
  },
  {
    "content": "edge that kind of looks like maybe like it's degraded a little bit so look at",
    "start": 945
  },
  {
    "content": "that little detail how that really adds some interest to that tile okay now I'm",
    "start": 954
  },
  {
    "content": "going to carry that over on to the top you know I had some cracks and",
    "start": 960
  },
  {
    "content": "degradation there we go add some little bit of degradation to the edges there",
    "start": 966
  },
  {
    "content": "pull some cracks just very gently takes a bit of practice",
    "start": 975
  },
  {
    "content": "but it really is a nice effect all right so check that out so look how that",
    "start": 988
  },
  {
    "content": "detail really adds to that all right so we'll let that dry and we pretty much",
    "start": 999
  },
  {
    "content": "have this done now so now we're gonna add the last detail which will really",
    "start": 1008
  },
  {
    "content": "just put this altar over the top so what we want to that",
    "start": 1015
  },
  {
    "content": "so what I'm really missing with this is a little bit Glor on the top because the",
    "start": 1028
  },
  {
    "content": "blood would splatter and then go down to the crevices so what I'm gonna do is use",
    "start": 1033
  },
  {
    "content": "my bristly brush and I'm gonna get that dark red and I'm gonna start just doing",
    "start": 1038
  },
  {
    "content": "some splatter on there now I'll grab some one lighter red and go right on top",
    "start": 1044
  },
  {
    "content": "of it that would give a little bit of variation see that's a nice deck there",
    "start": 1056
  },
  {
    "content": "also what I'm going to do is I want to have the blood kind of trailing into the",
    "start": 1072
  },
  {
    "content": "crevices of the altar so I'll get my thinner brush wet wet it down a little",
    "start": 1078
  },
  {
    "content": "bit get the darker red and I'll just kind of drag",
    "start": 1087
  },
  {
    "content": "a few trails into the and I'll grab some lighter red kind of help pick those out",
    "start": 1105
  },
  {
    "content": "and what's so great about this technique is this this just started out as a bunch",
    "start": 1121
  },
  {
    "content": "of cardboard but look how look how great it looks it looks really textured and it",
    "start": 1127
  },
  {
    "content": "literally almost has no texture except for the crevices where the blood is it's",
    "start": 1134
  },
  {
    "content": "all just simulated so you can do so much with a paint job and you know don't feel",
    "start": 1142
  },
  {
    "content": "daunted by this this just takes a little practice",
    "start": 1149
  },
  {
    "content": "now lighter red here we go but if you drop something there",
    "start": 1163
  },
  {
    "content": "so there's some nice gore on the top of that that went into the blood trails",
    "start": 1172

  {
    "content": "here or the blood furrow is here now another thing I want to do is when it",
    "start": 1179

  {
    "content": "dries it just has a flat appearance so I wanted to look glassy and gory so I'm",
    "start": 1185

  {
    "content": "going to use the the water base gloss to give it a nice glossy wet texture so",
    "start": 1191
  },
  {
    "content": "we'll let the red dry here and then we'll do that",
    "start": 1202

  {
    "content": "so here I've got my water-based varnish and I just keep this in a jar because",

  {
    "content": "the popped top tends to come up with the the varnish so I like to just use an old",

  {
    "content": "an old jar and put it in there so I'm just going to use a bristly brush and",
    "start": 1227

    "content": "the nice like I've always said the nice thing about this stuff is that it it",
    "start": 1232

    "content": "washes up with soap and water so and then I want to make sure I get it on the",
