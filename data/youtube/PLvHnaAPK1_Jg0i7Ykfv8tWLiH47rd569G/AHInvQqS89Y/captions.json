  {
    "content": "better to have this ring like this when I was doing this vertical shaft so what",
    "start": 157
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm going to do is I'm going to use some pieces I made and I made these cocoon",

    "content": "pieces and they're just thin cardboard that I've done the web technique on I",

  {
    "content": "the ring like they're damn they're hanging down from the walls so all I'll",

    "content": "do is I'll grab my glue gun and I'm just gonna start adding these on what I'm",

  {
    "content": "gonna do though first is I'm going to grab my tile so I kind of a reference",

    "content": "I'll put it on there get it Center for you there and I'll",

    "content": "gonna put him like this we just started adding them around there around the edge",

    "content": "make it easier for players to stand on these as they climb up the wall alright",

  {
    "content": "as they're climbing up and trying to hang on and fight so it could be a lot",

    "content": "of fun and that's that's a nice way to show that I also did this over the",

  {
    "content": "doorway because the doorway you know would be a certain height maybe maybe",

    "content": "the wall will keep going up even though there's a doorway there so that's kind",

  },
  {
    "content": "of a nice way to do that and this is a way you could do kind of a vertical",

  {
    "content": "thing like this and it's gonna this is gonna be a big part of the adventure I'm",
    "start": 337

  {
    "content": "doing so I really wanted to represent it with a piece like this but normally you",

  },

  {
    "content": "a ring for those like I did for the one I just showed you but I want to show you",
    "start": 387
  },
  {
    "content": "the the web bridges I made I just use a thin piece of cardboard did the web",

  {
    "content": "technique with the glue gun and I'll use this for bridges so",
    "start": 397
  },
  {
    "content": "there'll be one bridge going across here and one bridge going to actually how",
    "start": 401
  },
  {
    "content": "much there so I did the kind of scalloping on the end to kind of make it",
    "start": 406
  },
  {
    "content": "look like it was a web bridge bridge that was stretching across the ravine",
    "start": 415
  },
  {
    "content": "one you could have some fun with the players as they try to use this because",

  {
    "content": "it's going to be very springy and if more than one player gets on it it's",

  {
    "content": "gonna sink lower and lower so you can have a lot of fun with the player so",

    "content": "of players to be on at once which most of them art aren't that crazy but you",

    "content": "know if several god Ottoman want gone on it at once you could have the bridge",
    "start": 454
