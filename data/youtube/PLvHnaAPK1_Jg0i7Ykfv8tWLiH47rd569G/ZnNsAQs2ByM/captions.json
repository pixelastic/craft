    "content": "then I covered it with the cardstock the edging with the cardstock now the how I",

    "content": "got this nice detail on the door this is all just cardstock and paint so like a",

    "content": "normal door you would just have you might just put some bands and little",

  {
    "content": "of has blades that come up and I've got some locks for the characters to try to",
    "start": 157
  },
  {
    "content": "open so how I how I got all this on here was I cut out a piece of cardstock that",
    "start": 163
  },
  {
    "content": "was the exact same size of the door and then I drew a grid on the cardstock 1/2",
    "start": 171

  {
    "content": "inch by 1/2 inch grid and I did the same grid on the bear door okay so when I",

  {
    "content": "drew all this detail on the cardstock I simply would cut out a row of in a half",
    "start": 181

  {
    "content": "inch row of all the detail and then put place it on the board or on the door the",
    "start": 189
  },
  {
    "content": "same way that it was on the cardstock so that was a that was a nice way to apply",

  },
  {
    "content": "all the pieces to this door in the right in the right spot the grid really helped",
    "start": 200
  },
  {
    "content": "this is a technique that painters use for murals they'll do a smaller picture",
    "start": 205
  },
  {
    "content": "and they'll put it on a big wall and the easiest way to do that is just do a grid",
    "start": 210
  },
  {
    "content": "and then you can draw you know this and you draw a grid on the smaller picture",
    "start": 214

    "content": "you draw a grid on the bigger picture or on the wall and then you can fill in the",
    "start": 217

  {
    "content": "it's big as a wall but you know it's the same same idea",
    "start": 224
  },
  {
    "content": "and that's how I did this now the other side I just have some just some banding",
    "start": 227
  },
  {
    "content": "on it because it's that's the back side of the door but I didn't want to leave",
    "start": 233

  {
    "content": "it blank I want to have something on it so I just put I put some metal banding",

  {
    "content": "so to finish out the door I needed to paint it so basically I just",
    "start": 239
  },
  {
    "content": "baste it black like I normally do then I painted it with the sponge on both sides",
    "start": 243
  },
  {
    "content": "and the gray got on the the metal parts but that's okay I just repainted it over",
    "start": 248
  },
  {
    "content": "them with the gunmetal then I did a little bit of detail with some black and",
    "start": 254
  },
  {
    "content": "that kind of thing and I also use a little bit of red amber which is kind of",
