  },
  {
    "content": "wanna heat it up for about five minutes to loosen it up loosen up the glue in",

    "content": "the nozzle and then just use a glove to spin it off and comes off very easily",

  {
    "content": "all right so here's our cardboard and let's try it out so we'll squirt some on",

  {
    "content": "the surface and then you can kind of use that duckbill shape to drag the hot glue",

    "content": "to it thin consistency and I really like that that's something that's kind of",

    "content": "hard with other nozzles right and this would be great for like doing water and",

  {
    "content": "hot glue nozzles so really cool I really like this",

  },
  {
    "content": "the side right and that's not just an aesthetic feature it is actually a",
    "start": 294
  },
  {
    "content": "practical feature and it keeps the glue gun if you set it on its side from just",
    "start": 298
  },
  {
    "content": "laying flat in the glue like backing up into the chamber so just really smart",

  },
  {
    "content": "just a little more expensive than the CC better glue gun but it has a ton more",

  },
  {
    "content": "features it also uses the larger glue stick so you have more glue in your gun",
    "start": 317
