  {
    "content": "see with this hot glue since it's clear now I'm also going to go around the edge",

  {
    "content": "so that I'll do is I'll squirt you know stuff in the edge and just kind of cover",

  {
    "content": "up that corrugation I'm not gonna worry about the bottom layer because that this",

    "content": "to you know fantastic with that you just want to get enough coverage so you're",

  },
  {
    "content": "kind of covering the corrugation them but I'll just continue to do this kind",
    "start": 458

  {
    "content": "of technique or technique on here and get the texture that I want and I'll",
    "start": 463
  },
  {
    "content": "come back and show you what it looks like when I get everything on here so",
    "start": 468
  },
  {
    "content": "because it'll it'll take a little bit of while let's take a while fill this up",
    "start": 472

  {
    "content": "with this technique but yeah make sure you use the small glue gun because with",

    "content": "the hook with the big one you can't really get this kind of detail on it the",
    "start": 480
  },
  {
    "content": "small one is great for this so alright so I'll go do that and I'll be right",

  {
    "content": "back here I have all the glue applied and",
    "start": 486
  },
  {
    "content": "I'll give you a kind of a close-up there you can see it so that's the detail it's",

  {
    "content": "going for it's kind of hard to see like I said because it's it's transparent so",
    "start": 503
  },
  {
    "content": "what I'll do is I'll paint this up black and then you'll really see that detail",

  },
  {
    "content": "pop out so here's my hive I think it looks",

  },
  {

  {
    "content": "black on it CL does all that detail in there now when I got it painted up like",
    "start": 528
  },
  {
    "content": "webbing it'll look really cool and then I'll I'll leave these black and maybe",

  {
    "content": "even enhance them a little bit to make them look like holes inside the nest so",
    "start": 538
  },

    "content": "there we go and what I'm going to do is I'm gonna base paint this brown and then",

  {
    "content": "we'll come back and we'll do some more detail on it",

    "content": "dry brush technique so I'm just skimming over the surface to pick up the detail",

    "content": "holes inside get some paint on there it's not going to hurt it right now",

    "content": "because I'm gonna go back and do that later so you can see that detail really",

  {
    "content": "popping out of there make sure you get all the edges and I'll do this off",

  {
    "content": "put some lighter color on there and I'm going to use a vintage white it's not as",

  {
    "content": "bright as the regular white so I'll go ahead and get that on my pallet and I'll",

  },
  {
    "content": "use a wide brush like I did before blow it up the brush and we're just doing the",

  {
    "content": "make it look like webbing which is the goal",

  {
    "content": "detail and we'll come back to that also make sure you get around the edges I'm",

  {
    "content": "not going to do that on camera cause it's awesome move it out of the ranges",
    "start": 692

    "content": "are out of the viewfinder but there we go we'll go go to the next step",

  {
    "content": "gonna put too much on there I'm just gonna load up my brush a little bit and",

    "content": "make it look metallic you can overdo this but adding a little bit really",
