  {
    "content": "and I'll show you how that works so I'll put my sand down there and got my glue",

    "content": "I'll add some over here okay so now I've got my glue down so now I'm gonna take",

  {
    "content": "we'll get some water and wet our black down that's just black acrylic paint and",

    "content": "piles make them darker you can kind of embellish",

  },
  {
    "content": "find you are a little thin on the pile you can always add a little more black",

  },
  {
    "content": "also want to do the shading like I did on the previous episode tile so I'm",
    "start": 473
  },
  {
    "content": "going to do go along the edge that gives a nice shading that separates out the",

  },
  {
    "content": "wall makes it pop so we get that also gonna do some shading around the",
    "start": 492
  },
  {
    "content": "stalagmites and you want this fairly thin now I've also got do a few little",
    "start": 502
  },
  {
    "content": "darker areas they also might want to are also you're going to have the sinkhole",
    "start": 526

  {
    "content": "here so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to make it very black here and",

  },
  {
    "content": "then I'm going to fill that in so it looks like a hole and then I want to",
    "start": 540
  },
  {
    "content": "make this part the darkest now what I'm going to do is clean my brush off a",
    "start": 551
  },
  {
    "content": "little bit and then I'm gonna pick up some of this light grey",
    "start": 555
  },
  {
    "content": "and then I'm going to paint kind of lightly stroke the outside here so it",
    "start": 564
  },
  {
    "content": "kind of looks like it's a depression it's like going into the hole so I could",
    "start": 572
  },
  {
    "content": "kind of play with that some more it's kind of light so I'm going to add a",
    "start": 580
  },
  {
    "content": "little more black to that a little more you'll see how that kind of gives the",
    "start": 583
  },
  {
    "content": "illusion of that's going down into a hole so it looks really nice there we go",
    "start": 599
  },
  {
    "content": "okay so we got that so now we basically got the black areas done what I'm going",
    "start": 607
  },
  {
    "content": "to do is are let these roll piles dry for a minute and then we'll highlight",
    "start": 614
  },
  {
    "content": "the rubble in the pile so they'll really pop out really look nice",

    "content": "we'll also highlight the edge and we'll highlight the edge and make the make the",

  },
  {
    "content": "wall also really pop out so we'll let that dry for a few minutes and then",
    "start": 634
  },
  {
    "content": "we'll be back then I go back again we've let our black",
    "start": 637
  },
  {
    "content": "dry and now we're going to do some dry brushing and for this phase I like to",
    "start": 645
  },
  {
    "content": "use a brush that's as you can see it's not sharply chiseled but it has a little",
    "start": 652
  },
  {
    "content": "bit more chisel than the other brush so basically with a dry brush technique and",
    "start": 657
  },
  {
    "content": "set up wetting the paint you use a the paint you just scoop it up on the brush",
    "start": 662
  },
  {
    "content": "and you just get a little bit of paint on the brush and then what I'm gonna do",
    "start": 667
  },
  {
    "content": "is just go around the edge let's see how that fixed that edge out look at that",
    "start": 673
  },
  {
    "content": "just pops right out so I'll just go all the way around the edge now those rubble",
    "start": 684
  },
  {
    "content": "piles that just look black when I when I put some of this on there look at that",
    "start": 692

  {
    "content": "they just pop right out those rubble piles just pop right out of",

  {
    "content": "this right the background there and these rubble piles are flat enough that",
    "start": 706
  },
  {
    "content": "they shouldn't hinder your play now what I can do is I can also do these pillars",
    "start": 719
  },
  {
    "content": "and kind of make them pop these stone pillars go around the edges gathers pop",
    "start": 723
  },
  {
    "content": "out get this one and then I've got the sinkhole here so I'm going to make the",
    "start": 732
  },
  {
    "content": "edge I'm going to do the same thing to the edge so I'll drive verse that edge",
    "start": 743

  {
    "content": "without getting into the hole and so that makes that edge very visible so it",
    "start": 745
  },
  {
    "content": "makes it more interesting makes it more 3d and you can do a few little",

    "start": 772
  },
  {
    "content": "nice things about these tiles and when you're done they the texture paint next",
    "start": 779
  },

    "content": "makes them actually very strong so as you can see this isn't just flop floppy",

  {
    "content": "cardboard this is very a very strong tile the edging and you know the rubble",
    "start": 795

  {
    "content": "and all these other things tend to make these pieces very durable so they could",
