    "content": "me today i want to show how to do thin tunnels and talk about it i did some for",
    "start": 16
  },
  {
    "content": "ant tunnel system and i want to show you what i did the RR tiles were great for",
    "start": 23
  },
  {
    "content": "you know kind of squeezing or small tunnels whereas 3d tiles just fail",
    "start": 29
  },
  {
    "content": "utterly at this kind of thing also I want to talk about interlocking I'd have",
    "start": 36
  },
  {
    "content": "been interlocking with these pieces and it's a it's a technique you can do it's",
    "start": 43
  },
  {
    "content": "not very hard to do it's not the best but it can help a little bit so let's go",
    "start": 49

  },
  {
    "content": "here is a section of thin tunnel that I did and one of the features of this",
    "start": 63
  },
  {
    "content": "tunnel is that I had a little bit of an interlocking feature for these tunnels",
    "start": 69
  },
  {
    "content": "because they were so thin so you could pull this out and just slide it in there",
    "start": 72
  },
  {
    "content": "and it would fit in that little notch there so that's something you could do",
    "start": 78
  },
  {
    "content": "with other tunnels or tiles if you wanted to it does help with the with the",
    "start": 82
  },
  {
    "content": "keeping these kind of thin or tunnels together from getting uh knocked around",
    "start": 90
  },
  {
    "content": "but you know this not something you would have to do but this is this would",
    "start": 95
  },
  {
    "content": "always be an option I have had people ask about like interlocking tiles and",
    "start": 100
  },
  {
    "content": "this is one way you could do it you know it's not like a puzzle piece it's it",
    "start": 105
  },
  {
    "content": "still can come loose pretty easily but it's it holds a little better than and",
    "start": 111
  },
  {
    "content": "if it's just up against the edge like that so that's an option for you and",
    "start": 115
  },
  {
    "content": "with these since I had a lot of these thin tunnels in my adventure so I",
    "start": 120
  },
  {
    "content": "decided to do that now I use these in the mic layer and you can see those in",
    "start": 123
  },
  {
    "content": "the overall scheme of the cave system if you go to that video I try to keep about",
    "start": 129
  },
  {
    "content": "an inch in the for the tunnel itself but sometimes it may converge and be less a",
    "start": 134
  },
  {
    "content": "little less than that but how the the whole thing with these water that these",
    "start": 142
  },
  {
    "content": "were aunt titles within the might layer so they were tricky for the players",
    "start": 146
  },
  {
    "content": "because the players couldn't stand up in these tunnels so I had to do was when",
    "start": 152
  },
  {
    "content": "the players went would enter the tunnels instead of standing up like they",
    "start": 158
  },
  {
    "content": "normally do they would have to crawl so I would have the players lean over like",
    "start": 161
  },
  {
    "content": "that and that kind of simulated them crawling headfirst into the tunnel now",
    "start": 167
  },
  {
    "content": "one thing you'll know is this guy doesn't totally fit on there like he",
    "start": 173
  },
  {
    "content": "overlaps somewhat the edge which is great with these tiles for doing this",
    "start": 179
  },
  {
    "content": "kind of like you know if I didn't consider the squeezing the tunnel was",
    "start": 187
  },
  {
    "content": "big enough but if you did a dungeon where maybe it was a half in",
    "start": 191
  },
  {
    "content": "and they had to squeeze through here you could still lay them down or even them",
    "start": 195
  },
  {
    "content": "up if you wanted but they would they would definitely overlap the edge of the",
    "start": 198
  },
  {
    "content": "tunnel which is actually fine because since you have these short walls you can",
    "start": 204
  },
  {
    "content": "actually have them overlapping the edge without any kind of problem if you had",
    "start": 211
  },
  {
    "content": "this as a 3d type thing you can never fit a figure in there I mean it'd be",
    "start": 216
  },
  {
    "content": "impossible so this is another cool feature of these tiles that you can",
    "start": 221
  },
  {
    "content": "actually show something like this or like I said you could have an even",
    "start": 225
  },
  {
    "content": "narrower thay place where they have to squeeze through it now they may be",
    "start": 228
  },
  {
    "content": "standing on the wall and you know and stuff but that's just it's just you know",
    "start": 232
  },
  {
    "content": "the figure the guy can could would literally be able to you know beep",
    "start": 238
  },
  {
    "content": "smaller than his base but you just can't physically make a figure that way so and",
    "start": 242
  },
  {
    "content": "have it stand up so you know with these tiles it's great you can simulate that",
    "start": 247
  },
  {
    "content": "very easily that kind of squeezing that player might have to do to get through",
    "start": 252
  },

    "content": "an area you could have a tile come up and be in a pinch at a certain point and",

  },
  {
    "content": "the players have to squeeze through it and you know their bases may not",
    "start": 260
  },
  {
    "content": "physically fit on there but you just put them on the wall you know and then until",
    "start": 263
  },
  {
    "content": "they get through to the next slide so that's a great feature of these kind of",
    "start": 267
  },
  {
    "content": "tiles now you notice i'll show you another set of tiles will move to",
    "start": 272
  },
  {
    "content": "another set here's another tile another cave system part i did and i have the",
    "start": 276
  },
  {
    "content": "same interlocking things that just goes in there now you'll notice that i did",
    "start": 282
  },
  {
    "content": "some kind of texture on these now all i did was i just took the glue gun and",
    "start": 287
  },
  {
    "content": "went back and forth kind of an action i wanted to make it look like an ant had",
    "start": 292
  },
  {
    "content": "kind of dug out this tunnel and so I thought that would be kind of a neat",
    "start": 296
  },
  {
    "content": "texture to do it you could do this on like a larger furrowing creature or",
    "start": 299
  },
  {
    "content": "something like that and make some really cool effect that the thing is actually",
    "start": 303
  },
  {
    "content": "burrowing through so say you know my party is going through and they all",
    "start": 307
  },
  {
    "content": "decide to go into the tunnel so they're all you know I haven't laid out and then",
    "start": 313
  },
  {
    "content": "you know as I get to this point you know maybe an ant pops out you know from",
    "start": 317
  },
  {
    "content": "the corner um you know and then this poor guy you know has to fight it maybe",
    "start": 324
  },
  {
    "content": "this guy maybe this guy guy has like a two-handed weapon he can't possibly",
    "start": 331
  },
  {
    "content": "fight with that in this tunnel you know crawling on the you know crawling but",
    "start": 338
  },
  {
    "content": "you know hopefully he has like a secondary weapon like a dagger or",
    "start": 343
  },
  {
    "content": "something I can pull that out and try to fight with it so that's kind of a fun",
    "start": 345
  },
  {
    "content": "thing this is kind of a fun way to challenge your players where they can't",
    "start": 349
  },
  {
    "content": "use their standard stuff and of course the you know the poor mage back there",
    "start": 353
  },
  {
    "content": "can't see anything so you know he can't really attack it you know that and that",
    "start": 357
  },
  {
    "content": "thing so so you know this is kind of a this is kind of an interesting challenge",
    "start": 365
  },
  {
    "content": "for your players as well as a practical way to make very thin tunnels or areas",
    "start": 369
  },
  {
    "content": "where the players have to squeeze through these these tiles work great for",
    "start": 376
  },
  {
    "content": "that so I just wanted to show you this thin tunnel system that I did for my",
    "start": 381
  },
  {
    "content": "might layer and more close up and talk about it and I'll see you next time on",
    "start": 386
  },
  {
    "content": "some more dm's craft hey guys if you're really digging these videos and would",
    "start": 391
  },
  {
    "content": "like some more information or to talk to other crafters look at the link below in",
    "start": 396
  },
  {
    "content": "the description and you can join my form on the dm's craft we'd love to have you",
