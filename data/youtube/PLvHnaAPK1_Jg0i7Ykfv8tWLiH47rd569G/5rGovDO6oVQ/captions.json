    "content": "of a you know a fog of war effect I guess from from a video game it'd be the",

    "content": "this piece out very easily and we'll do that now",

  {
    "content": "piece of poster board here it's just black poster board that's all it is",

    "content": "and what I could do is I can try to trace it but then it won't fit in the",

    "content": "straight part of the tile or a part of the poster board and just set it on top",

    "content": "this edge but I need to cut this edge so I'll turn this around and I use my",

    "content": "table to help make the tiles not slide and also to give the surrounding texture",

    "content": "like I used I used a grass cloth that made it look like the outside so if you",

  {
    "content": "did a dungeon tiles you could put down a black cloth and that'd be great because",

    "content": "then you wouldn't see the table through it'd be like the black areas that",
