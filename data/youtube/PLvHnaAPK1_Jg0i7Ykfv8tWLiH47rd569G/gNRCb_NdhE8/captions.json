  {
    "content": "when it when it read it dries out it'll go back to being a piece of paper so you",

    "content": "know with the technique I use for this it's very similar to the toilet paper",

    "content": "technique so I'm going to take this and I'm gonna grab a just something I can",

    "content": "squirt it on there I'm just gonna do a strip and I'll do",

    "content": "straight-up piece like that so what I can do is I",

  },
  {
    "content": "can bend it up a bit so I'm gonna kind of twist it just play with it till you",

  {
    "content": "get how you want and then I'm gonna leave it like that so I'm using the tape",

  },
  {
    "content": "its form but I want to add some more glue so what I'm going to do is I'm just",

  },
  {
    "content": "gonna grab my white glue and put a dab on the end there I'm also gonna run",
    "start": 331
  },
  {
    "content": "another bead on it and then I'm gonna use I have this disposable brush but you",

    "content": "kind of spread it out on there now kind of help me not destroy the",

  {
    "content": "the shape I've set up and you can even like we apply it to them",
    "start": 365

  {
    "content": "and so we'll just do the rest of these and do you want to do this a couple",

  },
  {
    "content": "times I'd recommend doing it a couple times I've done it on the one side I'll",

  },
  {
    "content": "do it on the other side so do this a couple times and they won't move on to",

  },
  {
    "content": "the next step I have let these dry overnight you might find that they kind",
    "start": 384
  },
  {
    "content": "of stick to them but just pull them off the paper you can use something that's I",
    "start": 399
  },
  {
    "content": "use this pad you can use something that's not sticky you probably work",
    "start": 403
  },
  {
    "content": "better but hey this works too now you can see I've got various tons of",
    "start": 405
  },
  {
    "content": "different shapes like I with this one with this kind of tendril here I pushed",
    "start": 412
  },
  {
    "content": "it against the the roll the weight so it would stay that way",
    "start": 416
  },
  {
    "content": "and then once you get the shape you don't have to worry about it'll you know",
    "start": 422
  },
  {
    "content": "when you put the extra glue on it'll stay this is interesting too I also did",
    "start": 426
  },
  {
    "content": "one in the center and I pushed it against the walls of the Sun able to get",
    "start": 429
  },
  {
    "content": "a cool shape so just yeah work on shapes I have this when draping over this one",
    "start": 434
  },
  {
    "content": "has a little little curl on the top so just you know just play with that a lot",
    "start": 439
  },
  {
    "content": "so now we've got all these dry and they're pretty sturdy believe it or not",
    "start": 444
  },
  {
    "content": "now the next thing I'm going to do is I'm gonna attach them to bases and a",
    "start": 449
  },
  {
    "content": "great way to get a base a super cheap base is to get washers and I got this",
    "start": 454
  },
  {
    "content": "washer box I think I'm talking about for for like less than 8 bucks this is a",

  },
  {
    "content": "hundred washers try to get a hundred bases a basis for less than 80 bucks",
    "start": 465
  },
  {
    "content": "also they're a little heavy so it gives it weight now these are steel so if you",
    "start": 469
  },
  {
    "content": "use any kind of magnetic terrain or as alia tiles or error things or anything",
    "start": 472
  },
  {
    "content": "you can stick them to these which is great so you could use these four",
    "start": 477
  },
  {
    "content": "figures and everything so now I have I have this so what I'm going to do is I'm",
    "start": 480
  },
  {
    "content": "going to attach the tendrils to this now you can see that it has a hole in it a",
    "start": 484
  },
  {
    "content": "why it's a washer it has a hole now I tried to get the ones with the",
    "start": 492
  },
  {
    "content": "most hole in the center but there's going to be some blue go through so if",
    "start": 495
  },
  {
    "content": "you're doing these put something underneath so you can either pull it off",
    "start": 499
  },
  {
    "content": "or it won't stick to it so I'm just gonna use this the same pad of paper now",
    "start": 502
  },
  {
    "content": "for this for this part of the project I want to do a vine grasping fine and I",
    "start": 508
  },
  {
    "content": "think I want to just use one line on the on this piece so I'll do is I'll just",
    "start": 514
  },
  {
    "content": "grab my hot glue and I'm using the small one if you're gonna do this kinds of",
    "start": 520
  },
  {
    "content": "crafts I'd really recommend getting as larger and small and the large one is",
    "start": 526
  },
  {
    "content": "great for piles and everything and the smaller one is much better for this kind",
    "start": 530
  },
  {
    "content": "of detail work so what I'm going to do is put it on here you can see it almost",
    "start": 535
  },
  {
    "content": "fits that hole so what I'm going to do is I'm going to put a big glob of goo or",
    "start": 541
  },
  {
    "content": "a big glob of glue on there and I will attach this",
    "start": 546
  },
  {
    "content": "and you can stand it up how you want it if it's not exactly flat all right yes",
    "start": 555
  },
  {
    "content": "there we go so we'll let that dry for a second and then we'll move on to the",

  {
    "content": "next phase all right for this part I'm going to take my piece that's already on",
    "start": 576
  },
  {
    "content": "the base and this this is kind of the base is kind of nice because then I can",
    "start": 592
  },
  {
    "content": "it gives me something to hold on to while I do this so what I'm going to do",
    "start": 595
  },
  {
    "content": "is I'm going to start putting some glue on this tendril this will kind of give",
    "start": 599
  },
  {
    "content": "it some more texture and you can still see a little bit of spiraling from thee",
    "start": 605
  },
  {
    "content": "from the twisting if you want to kind of hide that you can put a little bit of",
    "start": 610
  },
  {
    "content": "glue texture on here you know it'll reinforce it ant as well",
    "start": 614
  },
  {
    "content": "as give it a nice a nice texture so we'll go ahead and finish this up I",
    "start": 618
  },
  {
    "content": "finished applying the glue to the to the tip to the tendril and you can see it's",
    "start": 641
  },
  {
    "content": "pretty cool-looking now when you're doing something like this be really",
    "start": 647
  },
  {
    "content": "careful that you don't kind of you don't rush it I'm actually just showing you",
    "start": 652
  },
  {
    "content": "one but I would usually do more than one so when you're doing this",
    "start": 656
  },
  {
    "content": "put the Tenderloin let that dry for a minute or harden up I should say with",
    "start": 659
  },
  {
    "content": "the glue gun and then the same with a tendril let this glue harden up because",
    "start": 664
  },
  {
    "content": "if you start to try to go out and grabbing it while it's partially dry or",
    "start": 668
  },
  {
    "content": "partially ha or warm it'll start pulling off so you don't want to take your time",
    "start": 671
  },
  {
    "content": "with this with its kind of stuff with when you're doing dungeons you can just",
    "start": 677
  },
  {
    "content": "put it right on there and then just stick the stuff and not worry about it",
    "start": 680
  },
  {
    "content": "when you're when you're going to grab it like this make sure you let it dry off",
    "start": 682

  {
    "content": "for a few our harden for a few minutes before you play with it so now I've got",
    "start": 686
  },
  {
    "content": "that that's really nice now what I want to do is I want to add a little bit of",
    "start": 690
  },
  {
    "content": "detail of the base somebody at my glue gun and I'm going to kind of pull out",
    "start": 694
  },
  {
    "content": "and you got to be careful with this kind of technique because if you put too much",
    "start": 699
  },
  {
    "content": "it will make it look like it's just a blob so generally what I do with this",
    "start": 704
  },
  {
    "content": "kind of stuff is I'll put a little bit of texture on it and if I'm not really",
    "start": 712
  },
  {
    "content": "satisfied with it the first time you can always add another layer if a give a fig",
    "start": 715
  },
  {
    "content": "a little too blobby for you you can always add another layer so there we go",
    "start": 720
  },
  {
    "content": "now I know it's Cleary but you can kind of get an idea of some texture so it's",
    "start": 725
  },
  {
    "content": "it really looks like a plant that's bursting out from the ground and that",
    "start": 730
  },
  {
    "content": "just kind of had some neat detail to that and that actually came out pretty",

  {
    "content": "good I don't think I'll have to do a second part on that but I now want to",

  {
    "content": "show this is gonna be a vine and I want to show one last thing you can do to",

  {
    "content": "this to kind of give it like a plant heat look so let's go ahead and go to",

  {
    "content": "plain white sheet of paper okay nothing special about it just a printer",

    "content": "on the paper try to make them pretty thin if you can taper them off that's",

  {
    "content": "great so we'll do about four or five of these",

    "content": "all drawn make sure you what let those dry I'm just going to take a pencil and",

    "content": "kind of draw a leaf shape on the end of those",

  {
    "content": "all right you're kind of like making a like a spear okay so now just take my",

  {
    "content": "scissors and I'll cut along leave a little bit of the stem on there and so",
    "start": 838

  {
    "content": "one okay so now I'm just gonna cut along the stem and then cut out the leaf",

  },
  {
    "content": "I'm actually cutting the the pencil mark off so here's what we",

    "content": "look like so you have that shape know what I can do is I can just cut this",
    "start": 886
  },
  {
    "content": "tint this stem to length like whatever length I want it to be and I can just",

  {
    "content": "glue it to this line so I'll pick a spot and I put it there",
