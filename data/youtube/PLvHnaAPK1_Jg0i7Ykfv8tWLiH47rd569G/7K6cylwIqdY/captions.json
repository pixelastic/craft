    "content": "is gonna curve this gonna curl in and then converge at the top and converge at",

    "content": "always just clip it a little bit that kind of clean these they object up",

    "content": "kind of random triangles on it and you'll see how I paint those when I when",
    "start": 270

    "content": "I get it all up paint it up but I want to do these triangles on it and I'm just",

  },
  {
    "content": "going to kind of randomly place them on this object so the best way to do that",
    "start": 284
  },
  {
    "content": "would be to use your white glue if you try to use the the hot glue you're gonna",

  },
  {
    "content": "burn yourself so better just a these come out pieces put some randomly on so",

  {
    "content": "go with this I want to do kind of a like a bluish glow to this kind of thing so",

  },
  {
    "content": "what I'm going to start with is a cobalt blue which is a fairly bright blue I",

  {
    "content": "mean it's a big brush and I'm using a glove",

    "content": "I've reused this glove you can wash these off and reuse them again they're",

  {
    "content": "the latex tend to break but finally you can reuse so I'm going to go ahead and",
    "start": 356
  },
  {
    "content": "start just on painting this on so I'm pretty much just going to cover it up",
    "start": 361
  },
  {
    "content": "because I'm gonna do some texture with the sponge technique on this so I want",
    "start": 367
  },
  {
    "content": "to I want to get a base start of the cobalt blue on here all right there we",
    "start": 373
  },
  {
    "content": "go there's our object so we've got that nice cobalt blue on there so I will let",
    "start": 379
  },
  {
    "content": "this dry and then we'll come back and do some detail work",
    "start": 383
  },
  {
    "content": "so I'm gonna do my sponge technique and I've got my little floating monolith",
    "start": 396
  },
  {
    "content": "here and say it you can see it's very blue so now I'll just start sponging",
    "start": 401
  },
  {
    "content": "that on this is a metallic black so alright so we'll let that dry up and",
    "start": 404
  },
  {
    "content": "then we'll do some more detail to it all right so here's my model if you can",
    "start": 418
  },
  {
    "content": "see it really has a neat kind of color it's got a dark blue kind of circling",
    "start": 432
  },
  {
    "content": "these protrusions on the monolith and it's it's kind of interesting but I want",
    "start": 438
  },
  {
    "content": "to accentuate that so I'm going to do is I'm going to pick out these protrusions",
    "start": 444
  },
  {
    "content": "these triangular protrusions so I'm going to use a Tahiti blue and I'm a dry",
    "start": 449
  },
  {
    "content": "brush I'm going to use a fairly bristly brush grabs live my paint on that and",
    "start": 454
  },
  {
    "content": "then I'm going to kind of pull from the corners of those",
    "start": 461
  },
  {
    "content": "coming if those Center is a little bit just to kind of fill them in just a",
    "start": 485
  },
  {
    "content": "touch but not all the way I like that it's got some dark in there",
    "start": 488
  },
  {
    "content": "not trying to fill out the Phillies in all the way so there we go really nice",
    "start": 492
  },
  {
    "content": "contrast with that Tahitian blue against the black and the the dark blue so now",
    "start": 499
  },
  {
    "content": "I'll finish this up and I'll give you a peek at what it looks at looks like",
    "start": 508
  },
  {
    "content": "so here's our finished monolith you can almost hear this thing throbbing with a",
    "start": 522
  },
  {
    "content": "unearthly power that color scheme is really really makes it interesting so",
    "start": 527
  },
  {
    "content": "now we'll move on from here and we're going to work on a base for this",
    "start": 534
  },
  {
    "content": "all right so here we go here's gonna be the base of our monolith and I've cut an",
    "start": 547
  },
  {
    "content": "inch I've made an inch square in the center and then four inches around and",
    "start": 556
  },
  {
    "content": "this is a bit kind of in relief like this now these are what's going to be",
    "start": 559
  },
  {
    "content": "between these boxes here now I've cut these these are an inch on each side and",
    "start": 563
  },
  {
    "content": "a little like an inch and a quarter on the bottom so they may not fit exactly",
    "start": 569
  },
  {
    "content": "perfectly but we can always cut those if we need to so now the trick is going to",
    "start": 574
  },
  {
    "content": "be to use our glue gun and get these corners installed so that's what I'll do",
    "start": 581
  },
  {
    "content": "now and then pop your now it may be a little off here so what we can do is",
    "start": 588
  },
  {
    "content": "after it dries we can cut a little bit off that's easy to do but now we'll hold",
    "start": 599
  },
  {
    "content": "that so I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and do the rest of these and",
    "start": 605
  },
  {
    "content": "then I'll show you what it looks like here we are we are a nice shape all",
    "start": 610
  },
  {
    "content": "together so it's kind of cool-looking there so but I do have a little bit of a",
    "start": 623
  },
  {
    "content": "problem I did have a little bit of over on a couple so what I'll do is I'll just",
    "start": 627
  },
  {
    "content": "take my scissors and get that edge and then just cut it right to the very edge",
    "start": 633
  },
  {
    "content": "so there you go that's easy fix there and there's one here too don't want to",
    "start": 638
  },
  {
    "content": "cut too much off just so there's our shape now I've cut this base for this so",
    "start": 648
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm going to go ahead and glue it to this base and I'll just glue around the",
    "start": 652
  },
  {
    "content": "bottom edge here so we will let this dry for a minute or harden up and then what",
    "start": 656
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm going to do is I'm just going to cut this out of the base just go around with",
    "start": 665
  },
  {
    "content": "the scissors and cut it right out and to finish this up what I will do is I'll",
    "start": 672
  },
  {
    "content": "take the little triangles like I did on the monolith itself and I'll glue all",
    "start": 676
  },
  {
    "content": "those on and I'm gonna paint it up exactly like I painted the monolith so",
    "start": 679
  },
  {
    "content": "you don't need to see that and then we'll come back and we'll move to the",
    "start": 683
  },
  {
    "content": "next stage now another thing I did when I crafted",
    "start": 686
  },
  {
    "content": "this was are painted it I painted some pearlescent on the blue to kind of give",
    "start": 697
  },
  {
    "content": "it a highlight and make it stand out from the base it's on so my goal with",
    "start": 701
  },
  {
    "content": "this project is to have the monolith floating above the base and how I'm",
    "start": 706
  },
  {
    "content": "going to achieve that is I'm going to use a skewer a wooden skewer now what",
    "start": 711
  },
  {
    "content": "I'll do is I'll paint it black to disguise it so it's not the wood color",
    "start": 718
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm also going to cut the tip off just a little bit but it's a pointed tip so",
    "start": 721
  },
  {
    "content": "it'll go right up into the point of the monolith itself so what I'll do is I'll",
    "start": 725
  },
  {
    "content": "uh I'll cut that off and then I'm gonna paint that black so here I have my",
    "start": 730
  },
  {
    "content": "components now what I'm gonna do is stick this into the base here so the",
    "start": 737
  },
  {
    "content": "monolith can stand can enough can float it above it what I'm gonna do is insert",
    "start": 743
  },
  {
    "content": "it into the base so I'm going to do is use a punch just this whole punch and",
    "start": 748
  },
  {
    "content": "I'll just get it on the Chris but about the center and get it in there okay so",
    "start": 753

  {
    "content": "what I'll do to try this out is I'll stick the the post into the base and",
    "start": 760

  {
    "content": "then what I'm going to do is take the mod lift and put it on top you know kind",

  {
    "content": "of give me a guesstimate where I need to cut it so I think I'll cut it about",
    "start": 770
  },
  {
    "content": "right there no no that's gonna be down some so I'll cut it like right there and",
    "start": 774
  },
  {
    "content": "try that out remember you can always cut more off but it's a little harder to put",
    "start": 780

  {
    "content": "it back on so it sticks pretty thick as I'm doing these thick scissors okay",

    "content": "get that in there that's right okay still a little high for me so I'm",
