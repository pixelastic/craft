  {
    "content": "embellishment okay so now what I'm going to do this",

  },
  {
    "content": "edge so I'll just go like that it's now I've got a piece like this so and I'm",

    "content": "gonna save these little triangle pieces cuz I go I'm gonna use them later on so",

  {
    "content": "inch in length and I'm going to put it right here so so I just measured an inch",

  {
    "content": "top so I could cut it in the triangular pattern somehow I'll glue that on there",

  {
    "content": "okay so now I've got that now I want to use these little pieces of",

  },
  {
    "content": "embellishments and I'll show you how I'm going to do that next",
    "start": 705

  {
    "content": "going to glue them on but since they're so small it can be really really tricky",

    "content": "show up so there we go I've got the smaller triangle on the bottom this this",

  },
  {
    "content": "next piece and then the larger piece now I'm also going to do a little piece at",
    "start": 767
  },
  {
    "content": "the top so I'll take one of these so this is a good way you can think of",

  {
    "content": "like little scrap pieces you end up with you can have a little bit of extra",
    "start": 780

  {
    "content": "interest to stuff like this so I'll just put this at the top here so there we go",

  {
    "content": "so now I got the piece at the top and the piece at the bottom and then these",
    "start": 805
  },
  {
    "content": "details come up the side so what I'm going to do is I'm going to do all four",

  {
    "content": "sides of this pillar and then we'll come back and we'll do the base",

  {
    "content": "you so I want to do a base on the pillar so",
    "start": 823
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm gonna do is I measured 2x2 squares on regular cardboard and I'll just cut",

  {
    "content": "those out you can cut these with the razor knife but this easy to cut them",

    "start": 874
  },
  {
    "content": "and I'm just I'm not I'm by balling this I'm not measuring it so now I'll go",

  },
  {
    "content": "ahead and go down on the base try to get as close to the center as you",

    "content": "can I'm just eyeballing it alright so they are got it on the base that gives",
