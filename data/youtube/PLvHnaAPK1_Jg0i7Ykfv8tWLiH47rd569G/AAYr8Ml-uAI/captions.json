  },
  {
    "content": "I'll do is I'll rip off on there okay so there we go we've got those on there",

  },
  {
    "content": "and what I'll do is I will do the other side and then what I'm going to do is",
    "start": 477
  },
  {
    "content": "paint it up black and then we can paint it",
    "start": 485
  },
  {
    "content": "but one last thing before we paint we have the edges of the corrugation I",
    "start": 497
  },
  {
    "content": "thought it might be nice to put a bead of hot glue on there and then put a",
    "start": 502
  },
  {
    "content": "piece on the end once it goes on there excess off so",
    "start": 511
  },
  {
    "content": "there we go all right so I got a piece on the end",
    "start": 531
  },
  {
    "content": "and like I said I'll do the other side I'll do this other side and then we will",
    "start": 536
  },
  {
    "content": "paint a black and then paint it up so I've got my thorn wall and here give",
    "start": 541
  },
  {
    "content": "you good look at it I did add some a little extra I added some of the smaller",
    "start": 557
  },
  {
    "content": "pieces to the center that were kind of empty so I did add that after the fact",
    "start": 565
  },
  {
    "content": "so and then I just base paint it at black and so that's ready to go but one",
    "start": 571
  },
  {
    "content": "thing you want to be careful with I want to mention again one thing you want to",
    "start": 576
  },
  {
    "content": "be careful with when you're doing stuff like this is this is going to be sitting",
    "start": 580
  },
  {
    "content": "on the tile and the type of tile I'm doing this is part of my might layer and",

    "content": "I've got these roots but if it sits on there it's gonna it's not going to sit",
    "start": 588
  },
  {
    "content": "flat so what I want to do is be careful I don't put roots where the wall is",
    "start": 594
  },
  {
    "content": "going to go so the wall will be at the end of this in the middle of the tile",
    "start": 599
  },
  {
    "content": "here so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to I'm going to draw a line where that",
    "start": 602
  },
  {
    "content": "would end so no I don't really want to put roots in there so when I when I put",
    "start": 608
  },
  {
    "content": "them on this is just an example I may want to you know I could go like this",
    "start": 615
  },
  {
    "content": "but you know like this things like this but I may not you know I want to be",
    "start": 619
  },
  {
    "content": "careful I don't get in that line so that this doesn't sit cockeyed on the tile",
    "start": 625
  },
  {
    "content": "this is it's flat so just be mindful of that when you do these kind of terrain",
    "start": 631

  {
    "content": "pieces for your tiles now I'm not going to show how I do this you see me do",

  {
    "content": "these things before here's the type of tile I'm doing you can watch the video",

  {
    "content": "where I do the roots on the tile to see exactly how I do this so I'm gonna do",

  {
    "content": "store you remember start with the dark and then work your way down to the",
    "start": 703
  },
  {
    "content": "lighter shades so I'm just gonna what I need to do is just paint this entire",
    "start": 706
  },
  {
    "content": "wall with this hunter green and I'm wetting it down somewhat so take your",
    "start": 711
  },
  {
    "content": "time with this don't rush now I've got the one side finished I'll do the other",

  },
  {
    "content": "side now I've got the thorn wall all painted",
    "start": 731
  },
  {
    "content": "green at the base now I'm going to paint the base of this a little bit different",
    "start": 745

  {
    "content": "color I'm going to use a brown and I'll just if the two colors and mix that's",
    "start": 752

    "content": "alright these are the roots thorn wall okay so now I will let that dry and then",
    "start": 762
  },
  {
    "content": "we'll move on to the highlighting phase as you can see this green is very dark",
    "start": 782

  {
    "content": "what I'm going to do is use a avocado to add some lighter green to it some of use",
    "start": 794
  },
  {
    "content": "a smaller brush here and like I've said before this is just standard craft paint",
    "start": 801
  },
  {
    "content": "nothing special and then we'll start getting it",
    "start": 806
  },
  {
    "content": "see how that starts to pop out there we give this wall some definition you want",
    "start": 822
  },
  {
    "content": "to get the spaces between the bushes to don't neglect that get the tops",
    "start": 829

  {
    "content": "all right and so there we have it our wall Florence will do the other side and",
    "start": 864
  },
  {
    "content": "then we'll finish off with the base so I'm gonna do one less little detail",
    "start": 871

  {
    "content": "on here I'm gonna use some of the tan that I've been using in my light layer",
    "start": 885

  {
    "content": "and do the roots so I've did some glue gun stuff on the bottom there and I",

  {
    "content": "painted it brown so I'll just gently go over that see that that should blend in",

    "content": "nicely with the tile all right so I've got that done so here's what we got have",
