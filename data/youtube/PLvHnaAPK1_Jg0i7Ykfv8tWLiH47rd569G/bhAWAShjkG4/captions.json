  {
    "content": "you can see I've got one ring one and ring two here on the photo now the first",

  {
    "content": "thing to do is glue ring one on the top of the other piece the top of the base",

  {
    "content": "and once I have that done I'm gonna put some glue around the interior there and",

    "content": "second layer on here second piece of cardboard make sure you get it all on",

  {
    "content": "problem here it's like how do we hide that edge that lifts off the surface",
    "start": 333
  },
  {
    "content": "right so I'm going to use paper towels and a cutting board a no stick cutting",
    "start": 338

  {
    "content": "board roll them up like cigars and I'm gonna put these around the edge and this",
    "start": 342

  {
    "content": "will kind of hide this height that we build up here with the pool to blend",
    "start": 348
  },
  {
    "content": "into the terrain surface right we will move that aside and do the other part",
    "start": 353
  },
  {
    "content": "here just spray it like we did it before roll up like a cigar and put it around",
    "start": 357
  },
  {
    "content": "the edge add some white glue and that'll hide the fact that it's just you know up",
    "start": 362
  },
  {
    "content": "off the surface it'll be a gradual slope and now I'm gonna add my pitch percent",
    "start": 368
  },
  {
    "content": "water 50% white glue and that'll harden that up there we go nice now that I have",
    "start": 374
  },
  {
    "content": "the edge roughed out I want to smooth it out and I'm gonna use toilet paper it",
    "start": 380
  },
  {
    "content": "gives me a finer working detail right gives me it's easier to work with in the",
    "start": 383
  },
  {
    "content": "paper towel because the paper towel is a rougher so I'm gonna start adding that",
    "start": 388
  },
  {
    "content": "toilet paper around the edge and I don't kind of blend and cover that cardboard",
    "start": 391
  },
  {
    "content": "top as well as blend into the rim around the pool here let's keep filling that in",
    "start": 395
  },
  {
    "content": "let's see we got it all filled in and now I'm just gonna hit it with 50% water",
    "start": 401
  },
  {
    "content": "50% white glue just go around and kind of just tweak it a little bit and now",
    "start": 405

  {
    "content": "we're ready let that dry up once the pool dries up I",
    "start": 411
  },
  {
    "content": "can remove it from the cutting board that's what nice thing about using a",
    "start": 416
  },
  {
    "content": "nonstick surface like that you can just remove it and I just put some white glue",
    "start": 419
  },
  {
    "content": "around the edge where the edge meets the base right so that'll help make sure",
    "start": 423
  },
  {
    "content": "it's secure then I added some small pebbles the JI got you could you just",
    "start": 428
  },
  {
    "content": "grab them out of your yard actually but I got these from Ikea you can get used",
    "start": 432
  },
  {
    "content": "fish tank pebbles or that kind of thing and then I embellished it some more with",
    "start": 436
  },
  {
    "content": "my construction sand it's just my irregular aggregates and so there we go",
    "start": 440
  },
  {
    "content": "now we're ready to paint after this dries so the pools all dry and ready to",
    "start": 445
  },
  {
    "content": "go but look at that effect I think that's just a really cool effect right",
    "start": 450
  },
  {
    "content": "so now we got to paint the edge so I'm gonna use a dark brown go around the",
    "start": 453
  },
  {
    "content": "edge that's a burnt umber go around the edge be careful you don't",
    "start": 457
  },
  {
    "content": "get it on the pool if you do that's okay you can wipe it off it's",
    "start": 462
  },
  {
    "content": "plastic and I'm painting the rocks so I gotta hit him with a gray and then like",
    "start": 464
  },
  {
    "content": "a tan color and then I'll hit the around the base with a lighter brown so I'm",
    "start": 468
  },
  {
    "content": "looking like poo right now it'll be nice when it dries up there we go now or let",
    "start": 477
  },
  {
    "content": "it dry now I need to hide the edge where the cardboard meets the top of the ice",
    "start": 482
  },
  {
    "content": "right so I'm use my flexible modeling paste I really love this stuff don't let",
    "start": 487
  },
  {
    "content": "the name fool you it dries very hard okay so I'm gonna start filling in that",
    "start": 492
  },
  {
    "content": "edge and covering that up and that not only does it give a neat effect it",
    "start": 496
  },
  {
    "content": "covers up the cardboard corrugation edge and I'll start putting it on the rest of",

  },
  {
    "content": "the base like snow and wow look at the transformation that looks so cool and",

  },
  {
    "content": "just super easy with the flexible modeling paste now I'm gonna use a",
    "start": 512
  },
  {
    "content": "metallic blue to give it a nice kind of icy Sheen right I'm watering it down",
    "start": 516
  },
  {
    "content": "quite a bit it's more like a wash I'm washing it over the snow and actually",
    "start": 521
  },
  {
    "content": "the ice and then I'm kind of kind of rub off some of that excess on the ice so",
    "start": 525
  },
  {
    "content": "neat effect neat effect after the metallic glue dried I found it was too",
    "start": 529
  },
  {
    "content": "prevalent so I'm gonna cover it up a bit with them just plain white acrylic paint",
    "start": 533
  },
  {
    "content": "and I'm using a damp sponge my damn sponging method and just stipple it on",
    "start": 537
  },
  {
    "content": "the surface and you still get those nice that nice sheen coming through you know",
    "start": 541
  },
  {
    "content": "and not in the shadows and stuff but it's not on the main highlights so it",
    "start": 548
  },
  {
    "content": "kind of works really nicely there so I just covered that up and move on to the",
    "start": 552
  },
  {
    "content": "next step looking so good love it onto the final",
    "start": 558
  },
  {
    "content": "step and I like to use glitter glue on this type of stuff it gives a really",
    "start": 563
  },
  {
    "content": "nice kind of highlight sheen on these like this twinkle and sparkle of snow",
    "start": 567
  },
  {
    "content": "and I just squirt it on and spread out it's so much easier than trying to put",
