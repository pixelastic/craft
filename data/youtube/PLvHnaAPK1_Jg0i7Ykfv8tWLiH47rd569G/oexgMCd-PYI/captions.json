    "content": "to do is I'm going to draw that in so what I'll do is I'll do back here and",

    "content": "to draw an edge for the boat not an exact science so there we go I've",

  {
    "content": "one and it looked like the edges of the boat so what we want to do first is cut",

    "content": "this out because if you cut this out first and then cut this out it would be",

    "content": "we'll cut the outside so now we'll just cut these out move on",

    "content": "from there so now we move that Center and we'll cut the outer edge off and",

  },
  {
    "content": "we'll be a lot easier to cut out than cutting the center out second",

    "content": "thicker cardstock I've got the rudder it's going to be in two pieces I'll glue",

  {
    "content": "that together and then I in my scenario I had a ram on the front of the boat so",
    "start": 439
  },
  {
    "content": "I'll glue that on the front so first I'm going to do the seat so I'll just take",

  {
    "content": "the seat and grab the glue gun and then I'm going to put it about the center of",

    "content": "the boat so there you can see it's in the boat so now I'm going to do the",

  {
    "content": "I've got going on there so now I will glue it to the boat so I grab my glue",

  {
    "content": "gun here so now I've got that redder going on you",
    "start": 492
  },
  {
    "content": "can see that okay now I have the RAM left I'm not going to put that on yet",
    "start": 503
  },
  {
    "content": "because I want to do a little bit of embellishment to the RAM and we'll go",

  },
  {
    "content": "from there okay so here's my RAM and this is just a",
    "start": 513
  },
  {
    "content": "piece of thin cardstock thinner than I use for the seat and I'm going to just",
    "start": 523
  },
  {
    "content": "put it on there and I'm going to trace around it okay so I've got the outline",
    "start": 528
  },
  {
    "content": "there so now I'll cut that out so I want this to be like a steel tip DRAM or art",
    "start": 535
  },
  {
    "content": "or iron tip DRAM so what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut it there and I'm",

  },
  {
    "content": "going to glue it on the RAM and then I'm going to come a couple straps okay so",
    "start": 553
  },
  {
    "content": "now I'll glue those on so now I've got my RAM finished I glued",
    "start": 566
  },
  {
    "content": "the pieces of cardstock on the RAM and I'm going to make it look like the RAM",

  {
    "content": "is Ironbound or steel bound when I paint it up so now I will do that on the front",

  {
    "content": "that boat so I'll just put some hot glue there and stick it right on so now we've",

  {
    "content": "got our RAM on the front of the boat and got our seat and we have our rudder so",

    "content": "we are set for the next phase and now we'll move on to the mast",

  {
    "content": "okay so I've got you can see here I've got two basswood sticks you could use",
    "start": 619
  },
  {
    "content": "balsa wood also one is smaller than the other what I'm going to do is put them",
    "start": 624
  },
  {
    "content": "like this to make the mast I got to cut them though so this one is about a",
    "start": 630
  },
  {
    "content": "quarter of an inch wide and this one's about a centimeter wide so but what I'm",

  },
  {
    "content": "going to do is I'm going to make the mast about four inches tall so I'll just",

  },
  {
    "content": "mark that like that and I'm going to make this jig coming out about three",
    "start": 652
  },
  {
    "content": "inches so this will be coming out of here and I'll cut there and I'll cut",
    "start": 664
  },
  {
    "content": "there so then I'll put the sail on the mast so let's go ahead and cut those",
    "start": 674
  },
  {
    "content": "so right here I have a little miter box I also have a blade that I use to cut",
    "start": 685
  },
  {
    "content": "this but you could use just a small saw or you could use a dremel tool would be",
    "start": 695
  },
  {
    "content": "perfect so I'm going to use this box to cut it so I'll put it in there and I'll",
    "start": 703
  },
  {
    "content": "just line it up to the straight cut and my saw on a wood cuts really easy and",
    "start": 710
  },
  {
    "content": "voila I've got them cut so there we go and now I'll cut the smaller part of the",
    "start": 717
  },
  {
    "content": "missed we have both pieces so now I'm ready to assemble the masked",
    "start": 726
  },
  {
    "content": "now you before you assemble those you probably want to sand them so I just",
    "start": 743
  },
  {
    "content": "have this little sander here that I can use this and it but one the other thing",
    "start": 748
  },
  {
    "content": "I like to do is put a little angle on the end of each tip and you can just use",
    "start": 754
  },
  {
    "content": "the miter box and the 45-degree angle and cut off so I have that already done",
    "start": 761
  },
  {
    "content": "so I'll show you the tube slides and I'll go like this now you can kind of",
    "start": 766
  },
  {
    "content": "see the angle there and I'll hold up closer so you can see that it's angled",
    "start": 771
  },
  {
    "content": "there at the top and I've just sanded off a little bit and the same with the",
    "start": 781
  },
  {
    "content": "with the shorter piece the bottom piece so now I'll just glue those together and",
    "start": 787
  },
  {
    "content": "we will have our masked so there we go we got our mast",
