  {
    "content": "I've got this on is take my glue gun and I'm gonna they're just kind of set on",

  {
    "content": "the tip so what I'm gonna do is kind of blend them in with the glue gun",

  {
    "content": "and now not only secure it better but it'll hide that transition okay so we'll",

  },
  {
    "content": "finish these up and then I'm gonna apply it to the base okay so I have my face",

  {
    "content": "but unlike what I normally do with the construction sand I'm going to use place",

    "content": "decided that I'm just going to use a place and for the earth of the project",

  },
  {
    "content": "so we'll let this dry and then we'll move on to the next step so my base is",

  {
    "content": "dried and now I'm going to reveal what it looks like so I'll just knock all",
    "start": 738
  },
  {
    "content": "that off all right so we got a nice nice base there okay so now what I'm going to",
    "start": 742
  },
  {
    "content": "do next is I will take this guy and paint them the black and then we'll work",

  {
    "content": "from there so from the tree I'm going to use a dark",
