  {
    "content": "looking great looking great so more 50% water if it's not white glue make sure",

    "content": "you get all those edges and things side just scoop up that extra okay here we",

    "content": "are and this is hard as a rock right really nice and looks great now more",

  {
    "content": "on there make another stone so just get it the shape I want",

  },
  {
    "content": "and then just cover with TP so you get a really nice texture on there just super",
    "start": 475
  },
  {
    "content": "easy and they'll just keep doing that kind of squish it to get a nice shape",
    "start": 483
  },
  {
    "content": "and I'll just keep doing that until I'm satisfied so really cool let's do some",

  },
  {
    "content": "more stones same technique this is just super easy and fun really",

  },
  {
    "content": "is and you can see even before the pain it just really looks great they look",

    "content": "here super super cool and easy once those pieces dry up I let to shore",

    "content": "them up by adding another layer of white glue and this is a nice solid topcoat on",

    "content": "paint it on and let it dry and you're good to go so yeah that just makes them",

    "content": "over the surface make sure you get all the areas where you put the white glue",

    "content": "and then through the magic of editing it's all dry and ready to go so I want",

  },
  {
    "content": "to do one last thing with this before I actually move on to the painting step I",
    "start": 617
  },
  {
    "content": "like to create the rock striations on the cliff and that's really easy to do",

  {
    "content": "with a hot glue gun just squirt some hot glue on there and drag the nozzle",
