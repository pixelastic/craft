    "content": "kind of foam on it and if you look closely at this foam it's it's very much",

  {

  {
    "content": "wedges and you'll see when when we apply those to the base why we cut those like",
    "start": 128

  {
    "content": "that so we got a lot of pieces okay so now we're ready for the next step so the",

  {
    "content": "is I'm going to take my white glue and then start putting it on the sponge",

    "content": "right and then just rub it into the sponge and let it sit so I'll do that",

    "content": "so I've cut a two inch thin cardboard base I'm going to do is I'm going to",
    "start": 230
  },
  {
    "content": "attach the pile to the base okay so I'll just get my hot glue gun and do that and",
    "start": 236
  },
  {
    "content": "then we'll move up to the next step okay so at this stage I've got the the mouth",

    "content": "on there and I put a little bit out front so now I need to move on to the",

    "content": "application of the blocks that we made and here they are you can see and",

  {
    "content": "they're they're hard they've hardened up from the glue okay so that's really nice",
    "start": 262
  },
  {
    "content": "really nice technique so now I'm gonna do is just start taking this and",
    "start": 267
  },
  {
    "content": "applying blocks to it so I'll glue that with the hot glue and then there",
    "start": 272

    "content": "so now just keep applying those blocks and then we'll come on for the neck will",

  {
    "content": "that I want to add I'm gonna cut this off so I will and then I've got a little",

  },
  {
    "content": "bit leading out from so there we go so we have our base so now we'll move",

    "content": "within the next step so I've got everything on there it's all ready to go",

    "content": "but I'm gonna do one last little detail and I'm going to just add some more",

  {
    "content": "white glue these are pretty strong but I'm going to make them even stronger so",

  },
  {
    "content": "now that I have them secured on there I'm just gonna just add block some white",
    "start": 332
  },
  {
    "content": "glue on there and now I'm gonna use a brush and just put it on all over the",
    "start": 336
  },
  {
    "content": "all over my hand there just put it all over the blocks that'll just give it one",

  },
  {
    "content": "last layer of strength so all right so I'll finish that up and then we will",

  {
    "content": "move to the next step now I need to put the smaller ruble on",
    "start": 361

  {
    "content": "this since I have the blocks all secured and so I'll just start using my glue and",

  {
    "content": "I'll just make puddles of glue on this okay and then I will put my construct",

  {
    "content": "pour my construction sand over it so which is just the multi aggregates and",

  {
    "content": "and then we'll come back hey guys here's my finished piece I think it came out",

  {
    "content": "really great so let me turn it around there so you",

  },
  {
    "content": "can see kind of a panoramic view see some nice detail the blocks the the",

  },
  {
    "content": "construction sand we use gives some really nice rubble effect on there and",

  {
    "content": "great looking piece and this was super cheap and easy to make so now let me",
    "start": 428
  },
  {
    "content": "talk about how I painted it so basically I just sprayed it black then did a dry",
    "start": 434
  },
  {
    "content": "brush a pewter gray on it and then a highlight of dolphin gray that's all",
    "start": 438
  },
  {
    "content": "there was to it just those few steps and it gave a really nice result so now I",
    "start": 442
  },
  {
    "content": "want to talk about why you might want to choose this technique over others I",
    "start": 446
  },
  {
    "content": "think this technique has advantages over several the others and here's my",
    "start": 452
  },
  {
    "content": "reasoning behind it one way you could do this would be to",
    "start": 457
  },
  {
    "content": "use like say cast blocks like say her start blocks but those can get really",
    "start": 461
  },
  {
    "content": "heavy once you start stacking those on the piece it makes the piece really",
    "start": 465
  },
  {
    "content": "heavy and another problem with it is getting the block the shape you want so",
    "start": 469
  },
  {
    "content": "you know you because you want you don't want all perfect blocks so you're going",
    "start": 474
  },
  {
    "content": "to want to damage those blocks and you're going to want to hit them you",
    "start": 477
  },
  {
    "content": "know with a hammer or something and you're just gonna get a very result you",
    "start": 480
  },
  {
    "content": "might get lucky and get what you want or you may not so that's",
    "start": 483
  },
  {
    "content": "consideration also just a lot takes a lot longer to do no casting is just the",
    "start": 487
  },
  {
    "content": "pain another thing is and messy another thing is you could use styrofoam which",
    "start": 493
  },
  {
    "content": "you know you need basically Union like a hot wire cutter to do this you got to be",
    "start": 500
  },
  {
    "content": "really careful with cutting it you know where you saw where I just pull the",
    "start": 503
  },
  {
    "content": "things off snip them and I was done I didn't have to do any kind of hot wire",
    "start": 507
  },
  {
    "content": "cutting or anything like that and you couldn't use the beaded foam for it but",
    "start": 511
  },
  {
    "content": "I really find that the beaded beaded phone was just extremely hard to work",
    "start": 519
  },
  {
    "content": "with this stuff is just easy it's just you I just cut it into blocks and glued",
    "start": 522
  },
  {
    "content": "it on and that was it I mean there was there was nothing else to it so those",
    "start": 528
  },
  {
    "content": "were a couple of considerations to it also the foam can be extremely light",
    "start": 534
  },
  {
    "content": "where this has a little bit of weight to it not nearly as much as a cat's block",
    "start": 539
  },
  {
    "content": "but it does have some way so anyways those were some considerations that I",
    "start": 543
  },
  {
    "content": "was thinking about when I made this I also like that the the the dense foam",
    "start": 547
  },
  {
    "content": "that I used has some texture to it it does look like stone so I think it's",
    "start": 550
  },
  {
    "content": "it's a great effect but anyways I'm finished babbling so let's go to the",

  {
    "content": "table I'm going to show you what it looks like on the tile",
