    "content": "texture on it'll kind of gum up the flocking and it'll lose the detail so",

  {
    "content": "what I'm going to do is kind of add some flocking random flocking it's kind of",

  },
  {
    "content": "nice to add it to the edge a little bit to the edges of these pools or cave",

  {
    "content": "exits it gives a little more definition to it",

    "content": "flocking really doesn't do much at this point because the texture makes it look",

    "content": "like stone but it's very flat this tile still looks very flat and",

    "content": "that's the great thing about this technique this part of doing our tiles",

  },

    "content": "is the most important part of course it's important to get your you know to",

  },
  {
    "content": "get everything glued on incorrectly but but really this finishing touch is what",
    "start": 507
  },
  {
    "content": "really makes the tiles pop it really makes them special so you know don't",

    "content": "skimp on this part if you're going to spend the most you spend the most time",
