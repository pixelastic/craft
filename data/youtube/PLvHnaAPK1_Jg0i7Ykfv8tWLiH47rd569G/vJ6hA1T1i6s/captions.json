    "content": "used was I used the inch long half an inch wide rectangle for this project",

  {
    "content": "to simulate the front legs of the chair I'm going to use the tapered sticks okay",
    "start": 210
  },
  {
    "content": "so what I did is I cut the point off the tapered stick and then I measured a",
    "start": 216
  },
  {
    "content": "half-inch and then cut that off the rest of the stick so those will simulate the",
    "start": 222
  },
  {
    "content": "front legs here you can see I've taken the cube and",
    "start": 226
  },
  {
    "content": "I've glued those tapered sticks to the to one side of the cube okay I tried to",
    "start": 234
  },
  {
    "content": "choose the sides of the cube that were the smoother there are two sides that",
    "start": 240
  },
  {
    "content": "are rougher and I thought that I would use the rougher part for the top and the",

  },
  {
    "content": "bottom now here is my chair totally assembled",
    "start": 250
  },
  {
    "content": "so I've taken the cube of with the legs glued to the front of it",
    "start": 257
  },
  {
    "content": "then I glued the back piece to the back so I've got to seat the headrest the",
    "start": 260
  },
  {
    "content": "square headrest there and then the the panel going the back and now the seat",
    "start": 265
  },
  {
    "content": "what I did is I I cut the seat from the rectangular piece okay now the trick",
    "start": 270
  },
  {
    "content": "here what I found worked for me was I laid the rectangular piece on the chair",
    "start": 276
  },
  {
    "content": "and then marked it where to the point where it covered the legs if I cut it a",
    "start": 282
  },
  {
    "content": "half an inch it won't cover the legs because the cube is it happening so it's",
    "start": 287
  },
  {
    "content": "actually a little bit over half an inch you can measure that and mark it that",
    "start": 291
  },
  {
    "content": "way but what I did was I just laid the rectangular piece on the seat of the",
    "start": 297
  },
  {
    "content": "chair and then just took a little pan and marked where to cut and then cut it",
    "start": 302
  },
  {
    "content": "then cut it you could do that you could make you could cut one as a template and",
    "start": 305
  },
  {
    "content": "then use it to cut all your other chairs because generally if you want to do this",
    "start": 310
  },
  {
    "content": "technique you Mazal do a bunch of chairs at once",
    "start": 313
  },
  {
    "content": "now here you can see I've made a group of chairs because there's no point to",
    "start": 319

  {
    "content": "making you know one chair at a time you want to make a group of them because",
    "start": 322
  },
  {
    "content": "you're gonna need it I needed a lot of them so I was making different ones",
    "start": 325
  },
  {
    "content": "now you also noticed that I had the square back ones that I made for this",
    "start": 328
  },
  {
    "content": "video and then I have some round back ones that I you that I made also and",
    "start": 332
  },
  {
    "content": "these were from the round back was from a set of woodsies that were very similar",
    "start": 337
  },
  {
    "content": "to the rectangular pieces they were just circles so they're just different sized",
    "start": 341
  },
  {
    "content": "circles so I just used this one of the smaller circles to make the headrest for",
    "start": 346
  },
  {
    "content": "the chair and gamin gave it a different look so that way not all your chairs",
    "start": 352
  },
  {
    "content": "look the same you can have different looking chairs in different buildings",
    "start": 355
  },
  {
    "content": "here I have my chair and I've painted it sprayed at the black and then I painted",

  {
    "content": "it with a dark burnt umber okay so now I wanted to I want to pick out some",

    "content": "of the dark brown showing through okay so like that and then I'm going to kind",
    "start": 409
  },
  {
    "content": "of pull to pick out those legs on there see that okay and I'll do the same thing",
    "start": 414

  {
    "content": "on the back all right now I also want to get the size because I'm going to show",
    "start": 422

  {
    "content": "you the trick I'm going to do with this chair to make it to simulate legs",
    "start": 431

  {
    "content": "without having actually put them on all right so there we go we got a nice",

  },
  {
    "content": "chair there but the site is filled in so what we'll do now is we'll let this dry",
    "start": 449

  {
    "content": "for just a sec and then I'll come back and finish it up so now I want to give",
    "start": 454
  },
  {
    "content": "the illusion that this chair has legs okay so what I'm going to do is that so",
    "start": 459
  },
  {
    "content": "you can see it I'm gonna take a black okay",
    "start": 464
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm gonna use a small brush and then I'm going to paint the front which is pretty",
    "start": 468
  },
  {
    "content": "easy because you know it has those legs on there already so there we go so you",
    "start": 473
  },
  {
    "content": "can see that that's nice now the side here okay",
    "start": 481
  },
  {
    "content": "make sure you can see that here alright so here's the side now I'm going to",
    "start": 484
  },
  {
    "content": "simulate the legs on the side so I'm going to take my black and then I'm",
    "start": 490
  },
  {
    "content": "going to kind of go in like this and then I'll do the same thing for this",
    "start": 494
  },
  {
    "content": "part for the front leg get it going like that",
    "start": 506
  },
  {
    "content": "and then I'll paint that in black so there we've got a nice - nice",
    "start": 516
  },
  {
    "content": "simulated legs on there now the the paint is still wet so it's a bit glossy",
    "start": 530
  },
  {
    "content": "but when this dries it won't be glossy anymore so - look it'll look a lot it'll",
    "start": 537
  },
  {
    "content": "look a lot nicer it won't be it won't stand out like it does now but this is a",
    "start": 541
  },
  {
    "content": "really nice technique so basically you just paint the other side and then the",
    "start": 545
  },
  {
    "content": "chair is ready to go here's a little hovel I made and our la",

  {
    "content": "rounded back okay and I did another chair that I did like a rounded seat",
    "start": 597

  {
    "content": "okay so even I even made some different chairs and I use the circular woodsies",
    "start": 605
  },
  {
    "content": "for that seat okay so let me give you a close-up look of these at these chair",
    "start": 610

  {
    "content": "now you saw me paint it now look what the how the paint is dried it doesn't",
    "start": 616
  },
  {
    "content": "have that gloss look like it did so it doesn't really stand out so I think",
    "start": 620

    "content": "these are a great alternative to trying to put legs little teeny legs on a chair",

  {
    "content": "it can be really really frustrating and just take a lot of time these you can",
    "start": 634

  {
    "content": "just bang these out very quickly because they're so easy to make okay and no",
    "start": 638

  {
    "content": "another side effect I like is it with the with the with the for small spindly",
