I finally built myself an airbrush paint spray booth! No more paint dust getting all over everything in the hobby room! \n\nBUILD LIST\n\n1/2\" MDF (6'x4'....I bought 3 precut sheets of 2'x4')\n\n1/4\" MDF (2'x4' sheet. I bought two sheets and didn't use most of one, if you reduce how far down back goes you can get away with one sheet)\n\nFILTER\n(USA) https://amzn.to/2B0Lz7M\n(Canada) https://amzn.to/32eHXeA\n(UK) https://amzn.to/2VvZWKS\n(Germany) https://amzn.to/2ID5RZl\n\nIN LINE FAN \nUK Amazon didn't list my fan so look for one that has at least 200CFM and speed control\n(USA) https://amzn.to/2pbhoYU\n(Canada) https://amzn.to/2pcWRTN\n(UK) https://amzn.to/2IHMNco\n(Germany) https://amzn.to/2IIgY2Z \n\nDUST HOOD\n(USA) https://amzn.to/33l83wr\n(Canada) https://amzn.to/35lzvMt\n(UK) https://amzn.to/31aCuDY\n(Germany) Can't find, check other country links for refrence\n\n4\" HOSE\n(USA) https://amzn.to/2pfvfNK\n(Canada) https://amzn.to/2M8xWcZ\n(UK) https://amzn.to/2nIPymA\n(Germany) https://amzn.to/2IXpRWT\n\n4\" HOSE CLAMPS\nThis set up used 4, but the fan came with two and the hose came with two so I didn't need to purchase any.\n\n4\" WALL HOOD\nI can't find the exact type I used on Amazon. Check your local building supply store. They are used for dryer and fan vents. Get one with a flapper to stop air from entering, and one with a cage if you live somewhere with lots of squirrels like I do...\n\nLED TAPE LIGHTS\nMake sure you get something that comes with a power supply, that is dimmable, and that is daylight temperature (4000k-6000k)\n(USA) https://amzn.to/2q6mtSR\n(Canada) https://amzn.to/2q6dcKw\n(UK) https://amzn.to/33p6rlj\n(Germany) https://amzn.to/33rAAAD\n\nTURNTABLE\n(USA) https://amzn.to/2VFevf5\n(Canada) https://amzn.to/3285cGN\n(UK) https://amzn.to/31e8zeo\n(Germany) https://amzn.to/2IHRC5v\n\nDOUBLE SIDED TAPE\n(USA) https://amzn.to/329Pzid\n(Canada) https://amzn.to/2M6snM8\n(UK) https://amzn.to/32kK14o\n(Germany) https://amzn.to/35oV1ji\n\nIF YOU DON'T WANT TO BUILD SOMETHING YOU CAN GET A \"PORTABLE\" ONE. IT WON'T BE AS POWERFUL, QUIET, OR PERMANENT BUT IT'S FAR BETTER THAN USING NOTHING\n(USA) https://amzn.to/2pgyuos\n(Canada) https://amzn.to/2B6J6ca\n(UK) https://amzn.to/2VAbtIV\n(Germany) https://amzn.to/2OLKhWx\n\n(As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases)\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n➳  http://www.blackmagiccraft.ca\n➳ Facebook: https://goo.gl/hvNgQL\n➳ Join the Tabletop Crafters Guild: https://goo.gl/RMMqoh",
