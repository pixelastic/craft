  {
    "content": "understanding is that you get different patterns depending on the orientation",

  },
  {
    "content": "the basic way is just to run them the same direction so I have a large one and",

    "content": "a large one and I'm gonna put my bit of green stuff in the middle I'm going to",

    "content": "bit bumpy at first as it evens out and then it gets smooth and we are left with",

  {
    "content": "tentacle pretty cool pattern on it so this one",

  },
  {
    "content": "creates kind of like almost looks like a screw so that's using the large ones",
    "start": 266
  },
  {
    "content": "both in the same direction now one thing I saw when I was researching that you",
    "start": 273
  },
  {
    "content": "can do is you can take the flat side of one of these and rectify the the ridges",
    "start": 279
  },
  {
    "content": "to make them a little bit flatter and wider so now it has a slightly different",
    "start": 286
  },
  {
    "content": "kind of look to it and this looks like an industrial cable let's do another one",
    "start": 293

  {
    "content": "using the large again but we'll run it with opposite plate directions place it",

  },

    "content": "in the middle so the bottom plate lines are going vertically I'm going to turn",
    "start": 305

  {
    "content": "these run them horizontally and see what happens so this creates slightly",
    "start": 309
  },
  {
    "content": "different pattern I'm not quite sure how best to describe but it almost creates",
    "start": 320
  },
  {
    "content": "these little square bumps which looks really really interesting then of course",
    "start": 326
  },
  {
    "content": "you know once you have your texture you can position these and let them cure",
    "start": 336
  },
  {
    "content": "okay so that is the large one let's try the small one just to see how different",
    "start": 346
  },
  {
    "content": "it really is okay small and small running the same direction this little",
    "start": 354
  },
  {
    "content": "should make another screw like texture but smaller and yeah this looks really",
    "start": 363
  },
  {
    "content": "good excellent for industrial cabling one thing I did not try apparently you",
    "start": 370
  },
  {
    "content": "can run these you have 45 degrees so I'm gonna try with I'm gonna keep with",
    "start": 378
  },
  {
    "content": "trying the big one just because I think it shows up on camera the best and it",
    "start": 383
  },
  {
    "content": "was a little bit easier to demonstrate so if we take this it's at 45 degrees",
    "start": 387

  {
    "content": "and I'm gonna take this one I think also put it",

    "content": "at 45 degrees you can't put the clip on both sides when you do this you have to",

    "content": "just put it on one but I'm not sure if I'm going to do this right here on the",

  },
  {
    "content": "tray although I don't know if there's a wrong way to do this I think any",
    "start": 406

  {
    "content": "combination creates interesting textures so this made more of a twisted kind of",
    "start": 410
  },
  {
    "content": "corkscrew shape it didn't turn out to all I don't think I got the technique",
    "start": 419
  },
  {
    "content": "quite right I'm gonna try it again this time I'm gonna press a little bit harder",
    "start": 425

  {
    "content": "and see if I can get a more defined texture from it oops mmm",

  {
    "content": "my green stuffs getting pretty sticky that didn't really work and put some",

    "content": "water about watering spit see if it stops it from sticking a little bit yeah",

  },
  {
    "content": "moves a little bit freer with some spit on there and I think that one worked out",
    "start": 453
  },
  {
    "content": "quite a bit better that orientation is a little bit more difficult to do and I",
    "start": 458
  },
  {
    "content": "think requires a little bit more practice than some of the other ones so",
    "start": 464
  },
  {
    "content": "now what I'd like to try is using two different sizes so I'm gonna use the",
    "start": 468
  },
  {
    "content": "large one on the bottom let's say medium one on top running the same direction oh",
    "start": 475
  },
  {
    "content": "that's really interesting this makes much more organic shape this is so far",
    "start": 483
  },
  {
    "content": "the one that I think would work best for worms or guts or entrails I really like",
    "start": 490
  },
  {
    "content": "that twist that up a bit so it cures in a cool shape the two different sizes but",
    "start": 498
  },
  {
    "content": "at opposite orientations so large size going vertically medium one going",
    "start": 505
  },
  {
    "content": "horizontally and I'm gonna put this other guide back on because I found it",
    "start": 513
  },
  {
    "content": "actually harder to do it without it because I'm not used to these yet so",
    "start": 516
  },
  {
    "content": "again makes this kind of interesting texture with these little square sort of",
    "start": 521
  },
  {
    "content": "spikes this would be really good for alien",
    "start": 529
  },
  {
    "content": "vegetation and bizarre vines what I haven't tried doing yet is running them",
    "start": 534

  {
    "content": "both horizontally and again I'm going to do large and large together because it",
    "start": 541
  },
  {
    "content": "kind of shows up the best both horizontally what does this do that",
    "start": 547
  },
  {
    "content": "didn't work too well let's try it again not very even because I think this one",
    "start": 553
  },
  {
    "content": "requires a little bit more technique to do properly but it gives it this almost",
    "start": 558
  },
  {
    "content": "kind of looks like a like a pumpkin stem sort of look to it again probably good",
    "start": 562
  },
  {
    "content": "for vegetation so that's just a handful of combinations I mean you could do so",
    "start": 568
  },
  {
    "content": "many different combinations of these with the different orientations and",

  {

    "content": "of the orientations are a little bit more difficult and would you know",

  {
    "content": "require some practice but some of them worked really easy right out of the",

  {
    "content": "even try out yet because I wanted to try the basic one it's the same thing just",
