I decorated mine to fit within a Death Guard army theme but you could easily make these into Necron towers or some weird fantasy style for Dungeons and Dragons. It totally just comes down to your painting choices. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n➳  http://www.blackmagiccraft.ca\n➳ Facebook: https://goo.gl/hvNgQL\n➳ Join the Tabletop Crafters Guild: https://goo.gl/RMMqoh",
