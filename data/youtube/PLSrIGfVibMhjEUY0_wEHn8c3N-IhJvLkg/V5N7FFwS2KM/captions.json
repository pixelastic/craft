    "content": "hoping that this works really well the trick to this that I can already see is",

  {
    "content": "very small brick pattern so they're give me a lot of detail in this and it's",

  {
    "content": "going to be crucial that I keep the pressure even across the whole piece and",

  },
  {
    "content": "especially with this one keep it running you know parallel so that the brick",

    "content": "pattern doesn't drift again I'm in a very awkward position here with the",
    "start": 430
  },
  {
    "content": "camera but such is life as a youtuber right here we go even pressure and it's",

    "content": "looking really good there I would say it's a success the",

    "content": "brick pattern came out really nicely there's one spot where I didn't keep the",

    "content": "pressure down but it actually still looks fine I did drift kind of",

  },
  {
    "content": "off-center so I'm wondering if when working with a brick pattern like this",

  {
    "content": "it would be better to use an oversized piece and then cut your piece rip it on",

    "content": "the you know straight brick line or I'm sure with a bit of practice it's easy to",

    "content": "it still works like on foam off the shelf now the really important part is",

  {
    "content": "because you can't probably see this too well it's painting it I'm gonna skip",

    "content": "ahead I'm gonna paint this using my regular painting technique that I would",
