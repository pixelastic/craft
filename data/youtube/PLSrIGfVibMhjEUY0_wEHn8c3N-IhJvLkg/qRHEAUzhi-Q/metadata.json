However Mike from TerranScapes has an excellent review of it here: https://goo.gl/TZFLfL\n\nBUY the PROXXON HOTWIRE TABLE\n(As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases)\n\n(USA) http://amzn.to/2lVNvEM \n(Canada) http://amzn.to/2pWazXF\n\n\n➳  http://www.blackmagiccraft.ca\n\n➳ Facebook: https://goo.gl/hvNgQL\n\n➳ Join the Tabletop Crafters Guild: https://goo.gl/RMMqoh\n\n\nIn this episode I put the Proxxon Thermocut and the Hotwire Foam Factory Scroll table head to head in a battle to see how they compare when performing basic foam cutting tasks. I discuss in detail the features and flaws in each to help you decide how best to spend your money when investing in a hotwire cutter for terrain building. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Magic Craft intro music by Black Magic Craft\n\nBackground music:\nKevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",
