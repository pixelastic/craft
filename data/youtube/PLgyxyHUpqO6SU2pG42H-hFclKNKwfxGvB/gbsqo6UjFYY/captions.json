    "content": "mainly add the textures here on this flat surface instead okay do you know",

  },
  {
    "content": "what to do yes rule number one you can never put too much of it",

  },
  {
    "content": "one thing about using flat foam together like this it will probably take quite",

    "content": "some time for it to dry so I suggest poking in some BBQ sticks or toothpicks",

  {
    "content": "we did that for one place that didn't want to stay in place",
    "start": 501
  },
  {
    "content": "okay take these a brush and a glass of water now the next step is to apply some",
    "start": 511
  },
  {
    "content": "sand as flocking on the ground so just apply lots of blue over all of the flat",
    "start": 518

  {
    "content": "surfaces spread this glue with watered water brush this base will of course",

  {
    "content": "warp a bit and go a bit I mean very much but as always it can be bent back in the",

  },
  {
    "content": "shape oh well the camera ran out of battery but this is how it looks after",
    "start": 545
  },
  {
    "content": "we have added all of the sand and stones and let it dry for a while okay so it's",

  },
  {
    "content": "gonna be my first time spraying on phone let's see how that works then you can",
    "start": 569
  },
  {
    "content": "try all right so far it's good no melting do as I did",
    "start": 575
  },
  {
    "content": "on this one I let this dry for a while and then I will continue okay take it in",
    "start": 595
  },
  {
    "content": "your hand that's too close like that okay and then you do it small chit chit",
    "start": 602
  },
  {
    "content": "chit I think our firm is melting and reach them out on some players try to do",
    "start": 610
  },
  {
    "content": "it like this it's Dennis is it done no it's not done is it fun",
    "start": 625
  },
  {
    "content": "keep going keep going we have very little melting so far one",
    "start": 642
  },
  {
    "content": "option is that thin foam is better than you are firm another option is that I'm",
    "start": 662
  },
  {
    "content": "very good at this so do you want to do a senator highlight yes do you know what",
    "start": 667

  {
    "content": "it is no ok we're really trying to do one anyway okay so you can spray on from",

  {
    "content": "the top here to make the top parts more bright",
    "start": 681
  },
  {
    "content": "yeah I think that's okay the terrain is done now we're also painting these minis",

  {
    "content": "we'll take a look at this minis later now you can start mixing some paint",

    "content": "first we can try painting the rocks with a dark brown so you can go ahead and mix",
    "start": 720
  },
  {
    "content": "some black and brown in here good now you can water down the paint and we'll",

  },
  {
    "content": "see how it works I haven't painted like this before so this is more like an",
    "start": 737
  },
  {
    "content": "experiment more than teaching it's not diluted enough now add more water",
    "start": 742
  },
  {
    "content": "something like this is much better so just keep in mind you don't have to be",

  },
  {
    "content": "careful at all when painting terrain like this just splash it on and it will",
    "start": 760
  },
  {
    "content": "look good eventually the paint doesn't even have to be even for this terrain I",
    "start": 767
  },
  {
    "content": "think we all must know to just use watered-down paints and washes yeah now",
    "start": 776
  },
  {
    "content": "we can start seeing a bit of the effect of the Senate I'll highlight you can go",
    "start": 782
  },
  {
    "content": "ahead and apply the rest of the paint on the ground why not just apply the paint",
    "start": 786
  },
  {
    "content": "a bit here and there all surfaces don't even have to be covered",
    "start": 794

  {
    "content": "good next we'll mix this brownish green and we'll continue painting on the",

  },
  {
    "content": "ground go ahead and just apply it to randomly wherever you want to on the",

  },
  {
    "content": "ground oops like that perhaps it perhaps oh",
    "start": 818
  },
  {
    "content": "don't that hit this tones so much just focus on the more flatter areas and",
    "start": 826
  },
  {
    "content": "you're gonna do it like this something like that looks good",
    "start": 834
  },
  {
    "content": "we'll keep this very simple so let's call the ground done for now next you",
    "start": 851
  },
  {
    "content": "can take some of this dark blue mixture so you can just move the brush nestled",
    "start": 856
  },
  {
    "content": "it around and to get some of the blue on the stone just no worries I really wish",

  {
    "content": "I knew about this blue stone painting methods when I started and don't be",

  },
  {
    "content": "afraid if you get too much paint on you can remove the excess with a wet brush",
    "start": 885
  },
  {
    "content": "or use some toilet paper this is looking fairly good already now what we're gonna",
    "start": 889
  },
  {
    "content": "do is a over brush with light Gray's do something like this",
    "start": 896
  },
  {
    "content": "remove the some paint first then you just brush over gin",
    "start": 902
  },
  {
    "content": "it is very easy okay go ahead when you do this step your rock surfaces will",
    "start": 911
  },
  {
    "content": "look instantly beautiful it must be hard with the right hand I can imagine",
    "start": 918
  },
  {
    "content": "here they might help it a bit too much",
    "start": 927
  },
  {
    "content": "pain but that's no problem we can fix that with black wash later if you get",
    "start": 934
  },
  {
    "content": "too much paint fix that do it washes later if you get too little paint well",
    "start": 940
  },
  {
    "content": "just put more paint on the brush looking good",
    "start": 945
  },
  {
    "content": "one more thing you can do is to apply some of the paint on these stones just",
    "start": 949
  },
  {
    "content": "lightly on top of them so once you think you're done with that you can start",
    "start": 954
  },
  {
    "content": "working with this one it's gonna be a dry brush I'll explain a bit of dry",
    "start": 966
  },
  {
    "content": "brushing so the point is that when you use this paint you have a very little",

  },
  {
    "content": "paint on the brush so you have to spread it out and get it off the brush then",
    "start": 977
  },
  {
    "content": "with a very little paint on the brush you can apply some paint mainly on the",
    "start": 983
  },
  {
    "content": "highlights here and it will look amazing let's see how you can do it for the",
    "start": 988
  },
  {
    "content": "first time painting fingers that is a good way to do it so you can go ahead",
    "start": 992
  },
  {
    "content": "and try it let's see it's best to make longer no movements like this long",
    "start": 1006
  },
  {
    "content": "movements hold of the brush like that and then good yeah this you see if it's",
    "start": 1018
  },
  {
    "content": "not that hard the terrain is already looking very epic and we still have to",
    "start": 1034
  },
  {
    "content": "add that more flocking a house breed yes how will we ever get the time to do all",
    "start": 1039
  },
  {
    "content": "of that yeah it's much better to paint terrain",
    "start": 1046
  },
  {
    "content": "on the floor you still have lots to do hey this method of painting worked",
    "start": 1050

  {
    "content": "really well I don't think I have seen this good XPS form stones",
    "start": 1060
  },
  {
    "content": "before congratulations yeah you are better than me one more quick thing we",
    "start": 1065
  },
  {
    "content": "can do is to add more paint on the brush the same andraka tooth we have been",
    "start": 1072
  },
  {
    "content": "using and then we make edge highlights some of these ideas will look really",
    "start": 1077
  },
  {
    "content": "good with a bit more paint on them like that the next morning I explained to Fay",

  {
    "content": "how to make the grass looking look good very easily first apply glue on a bit of",

  },
  {
    "content": "overhaul of the surfaces while you avoid covering the largest good-looking rocks",
    "start": 1102
  },
  {
    "content": "then you sprinkle on plenty of flock here we were running out of flocking but",

  },
  {
    "content": "luckily there was barely enough okay then you remove the excess flock and",
    "start": 1112

  {
    "content": "finally dry brush with a bright green apply the green wherever you want the",

  {
    "content": "grass to look more about what we do here is very simple only using one color of",

  {
    "content": "flock and then cheating with a green dry brush can save some time in this step",
