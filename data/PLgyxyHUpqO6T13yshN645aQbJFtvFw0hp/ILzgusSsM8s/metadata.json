Here is some guidance:\n\n0:15 SHAPING THE TORSO -\n\n1:11 ARMS - Twisting the plastic really worked well.\n\n2:03 PUTTING ON THE ARMS - Ignite the arms connection point then hold it close to the torso for a while to heat it up. Then stick it in, wiggle it around for a moment and then keep it still until the plastic hardens.\n\n2:59 BASE - You can also attach the elemental to a traditional base of your choice. Stick a toothpick or needle into the elemental and attach it to the base you are using.\n\n3:36 MELDING THE ELEMENTAL TO THE BASE - make sure that the fuse is thick enough for the miniature to be durable. The miniature I made is really durable. I could throw it at the wall and nothing would ever happen.\n\n3:45 BASE PAINT - Some crevices can be hard to get paint into, be careful not to miss some areas.\n \n4:20 BRIGHTER BLUE PAINT -\n\n4:27 PALE BLUE HIGHLIGHTS - With a smaller brush you can paint any protruding details much better than with the bad brush I used.\n\n4:51 WHITE HIGHLIGHTS - Some areas will be bumpier and chaotic looking, add more white to these areas to create an illusion of foaming water.\n\n5:06 BASE DETAILS WITH GREY - You could also paint some of the bumps into stones by putting on a thicker coat of dark grey followed by a lighter highlight.\n\n5:17 PROJECT SHOWCASE - I'm really happy how easy this project is and how nice it turned out. What do you think? Have you crafted anything similar? Thanks for any feedback.",
