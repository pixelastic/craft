  {
    "content": "alright that looks a bit messy for now now you just add the talent on the back",

  {
    "content": "move them around and see what looks best my way of doing this was to add longer",

    "content": "pieces along and under the wings then I added smaller pieces that point down the",

  },
  {
    "content": "point is to create some volume for the body this is how I made it on the other",

    "content": "will be glued on the back",

  },
  {
    "content": "you can also find this piece in the template I carefully cut out this piece",

    "content": "half of this piece you want the tips of the flames to be free like this all",

    "content": "this is the design I came up with for the wing details cut out the piece and",

  {
    "content": "then check if it fits nicely yeah that's good then we add glue while gluing on",

  },
  {
    "content": "this piece try to bend the wing into a nice shape when the glue dries it will",
    "start": 526

  {
    "content": "hold its shape pretty well I'll just work on this for a while and then glue",

    "content": "now you can reinforce the wings with the",

  {
    "content": "same PVA glue we have been using just messing with your fingers or then just",

  {
    "content": "use tools you know like regular people just cover the wings on both sides easy",

    "content": "with a stick and the glue I made some textures on the lower side of the wing",

    "content": "it is now let's make the eyes they are so small it can be a bit tricky but you",

  {
    "content": "can do this use a corner of cardstock cut away a tiny bit first then cut away",
