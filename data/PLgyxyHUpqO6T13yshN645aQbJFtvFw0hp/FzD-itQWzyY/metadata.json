The engravings should branch out before they end.\n\n1:44 STONE PLATES - It is easier to glue them into place if you bend the foam pieces to fit the curve of the torso. After drying, remember to apply some stone texture with an aluminum foil ball (you can see that technique in my other videos)\n\n2:06 THE BASE - If you don't have the Coarse Acrylic Pumice you can simply apply glue to the base and sprinkle it with sand and pebbles. Also, add some watered down glue on top of the sand/pebbles to make it stronger. Then just glue the elemental on that.\n\n2:32 PAINTING - The idea is that all cracks and indents should remain bright yellow and that the flames get orange and then red on the tips. To get a glowing effect to the stones, remember to paint the sides of the stones with orange and red as shown. \nI dry brushed the base and some of the rocks, remember to have little paint on the brush when doing a dry- or half-drybrush.\n\n3:52 FIRE ELEMENTAL SHOWCASE",
