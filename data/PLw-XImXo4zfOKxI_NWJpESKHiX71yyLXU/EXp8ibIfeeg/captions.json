  },
  {
    "content": "go through and paint some cracks and things like that and now we're going to",

  {
    "content": "do some edging as in video 5 with some white paint so just edge not all the way",

  {
    "content": "less at the shadow so they're you know what I'm using here is just a piece of",

  {
    "content": "card stock to make it easy so that the paint does not get on to the floor below",

    "content": "and this helps to keep a sharp edge as well so going all the way around and",

    "content": "doing the edges of the steps first that are towards the center of the room so",

  },
  {
    "content": "stand out and pop out and then as you've seen in video 5 we",

  },
  {
    "content": "also just do a couple of little highlights on the on the tiles on the",

  {
    "content": "floor as well just to just to bring it out a little bit and there you go that's",

  },
  {
    "content": "nice and simple and then we just do the walls and edge the walls on the inside",
