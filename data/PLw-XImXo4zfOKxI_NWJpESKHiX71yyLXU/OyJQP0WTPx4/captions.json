  {
    "content": "okay so we're making tables and we grab our usual ingredients the popsicle",
    "start": 25
  },
  {
    "content": "sticks and also the matchsticks and just grab a quite a few depending on how many",
    "start": 31
  },
  {
    "content": "you want to have made get a pencil ready and so now I'll just grab two popsicle",
    "start": 37
  },
  {
    "content": "sticks just to see the width here I'm looking for about two and a half",
    "start": 42
  },
  {
    "content": "centimeters about one inch in width so three of these gets me around about that",
    "start": 46
  },
  {
    "content": "figure it doesn't have to be exact so but just try and get it as close to that",
    "start": 51
  },
  {
    "content": "as possible and then apply the hot glue down the one edge and stick two together",
    "start": 57
  },
  {
    "content": "and then I'll stick the third one together as well using the hot glue so",
    "start": 63
  },
  {
    "content": "this is going to form the top of the table and we're going to measure out",
    "start": 69
  },
  {
    "content": "what we need in terms of size so my matchsticks are five centimeters so I am",
    "start": 74
  },
  {
    "content": "going to measure 2 5 centimeter areas so just starting just after the curve area",
    "start": 81
  },
  {
    "content": "I measure 5 centimeters to the middle in five centimeters to the other end then",
    "start": 89
  },
  {
    "content": "just rule so we can cut off those curves and then measure to the middle five",
    "start": 94
  },
  {
    "content": "centimeters and rule another line so now I've got two five centimeter bits and",
    "start": 100
  },
  {
    "content": "we're going to cut off the curves first and then we'll cut through the middle be",
    "start": 105
  },
  {
    "content": "sure to use a quite hot hot glue so let it stand and let it run so that you get",
    "start": 112
  },
  {
    "content": "a good bond of the hot glue because when you apply this and the glue hasn't had a",
    "start": 120
  },
  {
    "content": "chance to be liquefied a lot and has dried too quickly when you cut it it can",
    "start": 128
  },
  {
    "content": "come apart so then what I'm doing is I'm just attaching the matchsticks to each",
    "start": 135
  },
  {
    "content": "of the long edges matchsticks is a set of five centimeters long which is two",
    "start": 142
  },
  {
    "content": "inches and so that if you have longer ones you",
    "start": 146
  },
  {
    "content": "just need to cut them down to size so they're to down the long edges so now",
    "start": 152
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm just using another match ticket I'm measuring the inside between the two",
    "start": 156
  },
  {
    "content": "other matchsticks on both sides and then we will cut those out so that they will",
    "start": 160
  },
  {
    "content": "fit in the gap on the short edges then we just grab the hot glue and apply",
    "start": 170
  },
  {
    "content": "those to the gap and so now we've got a sort of upside-down tray well not really",
    "start": 176
  },
  {
    "content": "if it was a trade wouldn't be upside down but you get what I'm saying okay so",
    "start": 184
  },
  {
    "content": "now the reason why I do this is to increase the surface area so that when I",
    "start": 189
  },
  {
    "content": "put the legs on these more surfaces for the hot glue to bond to",
    "start": 194
  },
  {
    "content": "so it's both aesthetic and practical in terms of what I'm doing so the legs are",
    "start": 200
  },
  {
    "content": "now going on so just going to measure the legs as two centimetres and just so",
    "start": 208
  },
  {
    "content": "that you figure with on a base is going to be the right sort of height so two",
    "start": 214
  },
  {
    "content": "centimetres for that and then we'll just cut off the excess bits on those",
    "start": 218
  },
  {
    "content": "matchsticks because as I said they're five centimetres long and then chop the",
    "start": 224
  },
  {
    "content": "two in half so they've got four two centimeter legs then I apply hot glue in",
    "start": 229
  },
  {
    "content": "the corner and stick the leg in and just hold it in there to dry somewhat and",
    "start": 236
  },
  {
    "content": "then you just let it dry and then apply hot glue in each of the other corners",
    "start": 242
  },
  {
    "content": "and apply the legs now you will need to do by sight you know we'll need to",
    "start": 247
  },
  {
    "content": "adjust the legs because there will be a little bit crooked so just line them up",
    "start": 253
  },
  {
    "content": "with your eyes and make sure that they are straight you don't want skew legs",
    "start": 258
  },
  {
    "content": "you'll also find there's a lot of wisps that happen as well you can see some",
    "start": 265
  },
  {
    "content": "hanging off the bottom there and it's game you know expect that to",
    "start": 270
  },
  {
    "content": "happen when you're using very hot glue and relatively easy to to clear off just",
    "start": 275
  },
  {
    "content": "grab them and pull them off but wait till the the actual glue has dried",
    "start": 281
  },
  {
    "content": "before doing that so that you don't yank off the under-eye pieces so this table",
    "start": 285
  },
  {
    "content": "is a little bit unstable because one legs is a little bit too long so I line",
    "start": 291
  },
  {
    "content": "it up with the pair of scissors and a lop off the excess bits so that the",
    "start": 295
  },
  {
    "content": "table is now stable okay so there we have it and just clear off the excess",
    "start": 299
  },
  {
    "content": "wisps as I said before and then we're going to undercoat it with the black",

  {
    "content": "spray paint as you see in video two and I got an assistant to assist me with",

    "content": "the doors and how we did the bookcase I'm going to just apply Brown straight",

    "start": 326

  {
    "content": "so that it gets all over and it's okay if a little bit of black is showing",
    "start": 332
  },
  {
    "content": "through that's not a problem give it some depth but we do want to just apply",
    "start": 337
  },
  {
    "content": "it thick so that it will dry a dark deep brown so that's what it looks like when",
    "start": 340
  },
  {
    "content": "it's dried I've been doing two tables here that's why there's two in the shop",

    "content": "you can produce many at the same time depends on how many you want I don't",

  {
    "content": "really need to do more than two I find two is a good enough number for the",

  },
  {
    "content": "amount of encounters and size of rooms that I have now what I'm doing is I am",

  {
    "content": "applying yellow just straight yellow no mixing with white as I would have done",
    "start": 368

  {
    "content": "in previous videos so this is just another way to do wood and I'm dry",

    "content": "brushing the yellow on so I'll wipe off the paint on the on the paper towel and",

  {
    "content": "they look like on a tile once they've dried nice and easy so that's how easy",
