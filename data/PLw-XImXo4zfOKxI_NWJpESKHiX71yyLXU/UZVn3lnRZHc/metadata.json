  "description": "DungeonMasterG (DMG) continues his straight dungeon tile terrain stairway technique with an ascending stairway tile. He also introduces the concept of not going above the 3rd layer of cardboard. These tiles are for use in RPGs like Pathfinder and Dungeons and Dragons or any other role-playing game that can utilise 25mm miniatures in gameplay.\n\nSubscribe to DMG's other channel 7DSystem: https://www.youtube.com/7dsystem\n\n\nPurchase PDFs, Booklets or DVDs to support this channel - http://www.thedmg.info/store/\nWebsite - http://www.thedmg.info\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/thedmg.info\nLatest Subscriber Competition - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI96D3_2-yo\n\nDungeon tile construction technique was influenced by the 2.5D method created by DMScotty of theDM'sCraft.
