    "content": "edge I'm going to put another off cut piece and do that on all four of those",

  {
    "content": "areas there now the reason for that is to increase the surface area when we're",

  {
    "content": "touching the side of the pylons to this it's not a hundred percent necessary to",

  {
    "content": "do the step as you'll see later on work we we put extra bits on the pylons",

  {
    "content": "however because this increases the surface area it does make it a lot more",

  {
    "content": "stable so just do it on all four of those edges on the four centimeter",

  {
    "content": "pieces and what I then do for stability is grab a lollipop stick run some hot",
    "start": 528
  },
  {
    "content": "glue down the middle and stick that on the underside right down the middle",
    "start": 534

  {
    "content": "now that will stop the bridge from curving or you know if people are a",

  },
  {
    "content": "little bit full a kitty it was very careful when their cats",

  },
  {
    "content": "around specially with hot glue no kitty all right so that just is to do brace it",

    "content": "and instead of being so now you grab one of the pylons now you can see the",

    "content": "darkened area then place hot glue on that darkened spot and place the the off",

    "content": "cap piece across that on from the edge of the darken spot solution darken spot",

  {
    "content": "is the is the shorter edge and so you'll want to have that extra line above that",
    "start": 573

  {
    "content": "so you can see there on on the four pieces there's the the line above so now",
    "start": 582

  {
    "content": "we where that line above is you hold on the shorter end and then glue across the",
    "start": 587
  },
  {
    "content": "offcut piece and up the the the the long side of the panel and then you glue that",

  {
    "content": "to the base so as you can see here just run the hot glue across the beam and",

  {
    "content": "then up the long side and then holding the bridge and you can then just connect",

    "content": "onto that other off case to be cut pieces on the bottom and it'll also be",

    "content": "bridge so far and sticking over about half centimeter at each step on each",

  {
    "content": "step so what I do to hide that is to fill in the congregation with hot glue",
