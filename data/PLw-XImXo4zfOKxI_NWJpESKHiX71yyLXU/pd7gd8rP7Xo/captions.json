  {
    "content": "cutting into the actual other tile there you don't want to do that so the best",

  },
  {
    "content": "thing to do is to cut towards the edge now with a craft knife always cut away",

    "content": "the edges with the scissors just to clean everything up that's so that",

  },

    "content": "everything will fit together easily so now at the corner do all the long edges",

    "content": "first and then you may have a situation like I had here where you've got to cut",

    "content": "and clean up the corner so that it will fit together easier right so now we have",

    "content": "three pieces not you notice I have one piece a single tile there so I'm just",

    "content": "let's clean up the edges with the scissors okay so we've pre-cut all our",

    "content": "walls are now we're gonna attach the walls to the actual base I'm gonna use",

    "content": "the wall on top and put another one down the other side and put another wall on",

    "content": "okay so the walls are going over the edges make sure everything is flush and",

  },
  {
    "content": "you'll see that the hot glue dries very quickly so it's very sturdy and quick so",

    "content": "now we just cut off the excess now don't throw away the excess we will keep using",

  {
    "content": "X's over and over and over again until we have none left",

  },
  {
    "content": "so as you can see the wall piece that's left doesn't fit so we're just going to",
    "start": 410
  },
  {
    "content": "mark off the edges that we don't need and then use the scissors to just chop",
    "start": 413
  },
  {
    "content": "off the ends then just a line of hot glue and place the piece inside there",

  },

    "content": "and make sure that it's flush just push it down gently",

  },

    "content": "actually mark where the edge of the wall will be as you can see in the shot here",
