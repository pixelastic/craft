    "content": "what I also do is rub it down to remove any excess glue do not be careful",

    "content": "matchstick and leave one side just sticking over and put the rest of flush",

  {
    "content": "pencil so that I know where to put the glue we'll do that now all the hot glue",

  {
    "content": "to burn yourself clean off all the wisps so now what I do with the offcuts is I",

  },
  {
    "content": "use that that'll be less like it burn yourself and then with the scissors I'm",
    "start": 300
  },
  {
    "content": "just gonna lop off the pieces of matchstick they were sticking over so",
    "start": 304
  },
  {
    "content": "there we've got the basic door piece and we need to add a base to it so front and",

  },
  {
    "content": "back all right so grab some card stock and we're gonna use the toilet roll",
    "start": 312
  },
  {
    "content": "again because it's the perfect size and just trace a circle around yeah we have",
    "start": 318
  },
  {
    "content": "it and now I'm gonna find the midpoint or on of the circle and go to the actual",
    "start": 324
  },
  {
    "content": "middle of the circle and draw a mark there and then measure from that half a",
    "start": 331
  },
  {
    "content": "centimeter from that I'm just gonna mark that line on the edges of the circle and",
    "start": 336
  },
  {
    "content": "then connect it with the ruler so now I'm gonna have a smaller semicircle and",
    "start": 341
  },
  {
    "content": "a larger semicircle so that's so that we have a piece can be jutting out the back",
    "start": 345
  },
  {
    "content": "of the door for stability so we're gonna cut along that line we've just created",
    "start": 353
  },
  {
    "content": "and then cut out the larger semicircle okay now at the middle point of what",
    "start": 356
  },
  {
    "content": "would have been the full circle are now placing hot glue and put the door there",
    "start": 367
  },
  {
    "content": "so you'll see there's a bit of of the card still sticking out the back and the",
    "start": 371
  },
  {
    "content": "glue crack dries pretty quickly so you can it will be quite quick that this",
    "start": 375
  },
  {
    "content": "will become finished there you go you can see it's quite sturdy now what I've",
    "start": 380
  },
  {
    "content": "done is I've gone to the craft store and I've found these little metal rings they",
    "start": 385
  },
  {
    "content": "weren't very expensive I think I spend about 50 cents on those so there I'm",
    "start": 388
  },
  {
    "content": "gonna put a little bit of hot glue and I'm just gonna dab the little ring into",

  {
    "content": "it at an angle and that makes a nice little sort of old-style door handle so",

    "content": "I'm gonna do that on the front and also on the back as well so just dab of hot",

  },
  {
    "content": "glue again be careful not to burn yourself and",
    "start": 409
  },
  {
    "content": "stick that little ring in there now you can use a little washer if you can find",

  },
  {
    "content": "very small washers a friend of mine had some but I couldn't find anymore so I",
    "start": 417

  {
    "content": "decided on these little rings because they look pretty good",
    "start": 422

  {
    "content": "so I've base coated it as we did in video three and I'm going to apply it",

  {
    "content": "just a straight Brown onto it so I'm using boots of speed here I've wet the",

    "content": "brush a little bit and with boots of speed I'm now just going to cover the",

  {
    "content": "doesn't matter if we're covering up the base coat some of it will still come",

  },
  {
    "content": "through but that's not the most important thing the most important thing",
    "start": 450
  },
  {
    "content": "is just to make the door Brown so you continue going over it going over it and",
    "start": 453
  },
  {
    "content": "get out all the little bits and pieces and also along all the edges as well",
    "start": 458

    "content": "always make sure you get the edges because that's the last thing you want",
    "start": 463

  {
    "content": "to look in correct okay so now to the brown I add a yellow mix it up again",

    "content": "with boots of speed so I've got a sort of a tan II type of color and I'm gonna",

    "content": "go still the the brown paint is wet using boots of speed here just to speed",
    "start": 482

    "content": "it up and I'm gonna go over the whole door again and it's gonna be a quite a",

  {
    "content": "murky mucky looking Brown and that's the kind of look we're looking for it's an",

    "content": "old old sort of door and been in the dungeon a while so that's the sort of",

  {
    "content": "color scheme but this is the way I like to do it okay and that's what it looks",
    "start": 506
  },
  {
    "content": "like at the moment so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna add the stone texture",
    "start": 512
  },
  {
    "content": "the basic stone texture now you could have done this originally to the card",
    "start": 517
  },

    "content": "and then added it later I'm just painting it on now but you could use the",
    "start": 522

    "content": "come on kitty keep moving keep moving all right so we're adding the tile",

    "content": "those up as and boots of speed here and we're gonna get a really light sort of",
