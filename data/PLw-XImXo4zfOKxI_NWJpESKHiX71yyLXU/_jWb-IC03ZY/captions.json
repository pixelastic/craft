    "content": "there is slight differences in the circumference and you don't want there",

  {
    "content": "to be holes and things like that so there we go that's the second one you",

  {
    "content": "can see there's a little bit of an overlap there so I'm just going to use",

  {
    "content": "the scissors to just trim off the overlap the third one now this is not",

  },
  {
    "content": "very hard okay anyone at any skill level should be able to do this without any",

    "content": "problem whatsoever you will get wisps that are those thin",

  {
    "content": "bits of blue that stick around and just a lot more for the excess with the if",

  {
    "content": "this is errs you know it will just be careful with hot glue because it does",

    "content": "get very hot especially if it's been sitting and getting runny for a while it",
    "start": 416

  {
    "content": "will be very hot in it and it can burn you alright so there we go that's the",

  },
  {
    "content": "last one and there we have four so now I'm going to grab a six and a half",

  {
    "content": "centimeter square that you can see in video twos - how do we produce those and",

  {
    "content": "you know sort of block off the area of where it's going to be so now I'm just",

  },
  {
    "content": "marking not not being not going all the way around I'm just marking the edges",

    "content": "where there should be so I know where the pillars should be glued and applying",

    "content": "you can see very very easy the pillars have pretty much taken shape",

  {
    "content": "now all that needs to be done is just do the I'm going to go over the base again",

  {
    "content": "so that if you if you look at pictures of pillars and things the ones that",

    "content": "usually are outside of big government buildings and things like that there's",

    "content": "the pillar around so that the hot glue forms that bulbous base at the bottom",

  {
    "content": "the way up to this to the roof I've effectively cut them up",

  {
    "content": "corrugation from the side when it's in play alright so just you know filling it",
    "start": 582

  {
    "content": "and go over it a couple of times if you need to so now I've based the columns as",

  {
    "content": "we do in video three and I'm just creating a gray with black and white",

    "content": "I'm just going over it just to get a bit of gray and a bit of black on there and",
