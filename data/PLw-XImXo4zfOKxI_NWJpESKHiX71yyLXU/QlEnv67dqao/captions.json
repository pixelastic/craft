    "content": "interesting cracks in the corner and put the lines on the wall so what I",

    "content": "edges of some of the little stone areas just to add a little bit of visual",

    "content": "the monotony of what it looks like and just adds just a little bit extra and",

  },

    "content": "that really sells it so the next main thing that I do is is to edge the walls",

    "content": "you want to do is you want to skip the black line so don't pull it over the",

    "content": "that there's wall segments there and again because it's not uniform it you",

    "content": "know it looks like it's sort of roughly human war which is the effect we want so",

    "content": "this is a sort of an edging effect to some whatever you could do this in dry",

    "content": "contrast between the finished tile and the incomplete tile that it finished all",

  },
  {
    "content": "will paint use a little bit quite a bit of white but again still on the first",
    "start": 414

    "content": "tube and I've done eighty pieces so you want to just you know keep keep",

  },
  {
    "content": "looking to make sure you haven't missed any areas you know check the edges and",
    "start": 432
  },
  {
    "content": "things like that I really just edged anything that's",
    "start": 437
  },
  {
    "content": "above the first level so anything that's at the floor level I don't I don't do",
    "start": 440

    "content": "any edging but anything that's above the floor level I do so you'll see in later",

    "content": "videos when we go above this wall layer to a third layer and you can see that I",

    "content": "take very long I have sped this up with my boots of speed just so that you're",

  },
  {
    "content": "not boring you to death and but the effect is very nice and it",
