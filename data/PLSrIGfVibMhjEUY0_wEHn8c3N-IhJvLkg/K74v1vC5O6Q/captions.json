    "content": "soon as I let go we're done you know in retrospect maybe I should have actually",

    "content": "one side and then move on to the next pillar so that this can dry and not",

    "content": "make a test piece this is me learning right along with you guys which is often",

  },
  {
    "content": "the case when I make my videos",
    "start": 597
  },
  {
    "content": "so I learned a couple things doing this",
    "start": 610
  },
  {
    "content": "one is that it actually didn't make sense to do one side then go to this one",
    "start": 632
  },
  {
    "content": "then this one then this one and then back and turn it I wasn't very efficient",
    "start": 637
  },
  {
    "content": "and also this glue takes too long to dry and even by the time I made it through",
    "start": 640
  },
  {
    "content": "it wasn't dry yet so this point listen I just ended up doing one way all the way",
    "start": 645
  },
  {
    "content": "around I also noticed that I had to use a fair bit of glue it's dangerous to put",
    "start": 648
  },
  {
    "content": "it on too thin because then it dries out very quickly and doesn't make a good",
    "start": 654
  },
  {
    "content": "bond so I was putting it on pretty heavy on the piece and I was also taking a",
    "start": 658
  },
  {
    "content": "little bit of extra glue and wiping it on the bigger interior piece so that I",
    "start": 662
  },
  {
    "content": "was gluing wet to wet which actually made the bond much stronger since I knew",
    "start": 667
  },
  {
    "content": "I'd have to wait for this glue to dry I used at the same time to apply some",

  {
    "content": "joint compound into the seams here to fill that gap that I'd mentioned earlier",
    "start": 677

  {
    "content": "this way I could take advantage of both of these things drying at the same time",
    "start": 682
  },
  {
    "content": "I got to assemble these but before I do that I do want to add a little bit of",
    "start": 687

  {
    "content": "stone texture so I'm gonna do this separately while they're apart I don't",
