I constructed it very cheaply, for under $70. I also review the things I like and dislike about it now that I've used it for quite a while and talk about what I am going to do differently when I build the next one. \n\nI primarily use this table to play Dungeons & Dragons but it's design would work for numerous tabletop games. \n\n#DIY #DnD #gamingtable \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n➳  http://www.blackmagiccraft.ca\n➳ Facebook: https://goo.gl/hvNgQL\n➳ Join the Tabletop Crafters Guild: https://goo.gl/RMMqoh",
