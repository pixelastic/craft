    "content": "difference between the pink foam and the green foam is this is very",

    "content": "available because in North America we mostly have this pink foam you are and",

    "content": "then the blue foam by dow which is actually as we played it a little bit",
    "start": 334

    "content": "even slightly softer excellent than this one and i discovered that if you you",

  },
  {
    "content": "apply the right technique i can actually use this foam as well in a way that I",

  {
    "content": "can work in layers you know two or three layers within one sheet this is already",
    "start": 351

    "content": "so much worth it yeah for me to discover pay a visit and to discover how to",

  {
    "content": "actually work in foam in this type of foam almost in the same way as I'm used",

    "content": "taking the inspiration and the idea and trying and developing techniques or",

  },
  {
    "content": "ideas with what you have available when I worked with this foam tried your",

  {
    "content": "techniques and yeah was frustrated by not working the way I expected it to I",

  },
  {
    "content": "wrote off those other techniques too quickly yes I should have come back to",

    "content": "them maybe after learning more trying different things come back with a new",

    "content": "adding to a structure that creates a a lot of limitations on depth and it's",

  {
    "content": "kind of difficult to explain but the way you work in layers of cutting out a a",

  },
  {
    "content": "window because you're drawing on every texture all parts of the phone become",
    "start": 421

    "content": "the foam the form the form but if I have a flat piece of foam and I add",

    "content": "individual bricks to it or wood planks and then I cut out a window then there's",

  {
    "content": "this ugly layer yes that doesn't quite work and I could then go in and texture",

  {
    "content": "that yeah but somehow the combination isn't as believable if it's all in a",
    "start": 441
  },
  {
    "content": "similar way in the way you explain this now I think man that's way more work and",
    "start": 447
  },
  {
    "content": "then the way I do it don't get me wrong I mean the way you work when it works",
    "start": 454

  {
    "content": "it's okay works it works and the way I work okay it works for me the thing is",

    "content": "you can you can change the way you work and sometimes you can you find them or",

  },
  {
    "content": "absolutely project one project might be better for this one project might be",
    "start": 469
  },
  {
    "content": "better for that what I've learned from working with the pink foam is that both",

  {
    "content": "have their advantages and disadvantages basically you can work with both both or",

    "content": "also not a full pencil but this is way too long watch the pencil where it is",

    "content": "shallow yes so I get sharper lines and let's say this is fluster and which",

  {
    "content": "means that the plaster here has fallen off as you can see now I going one level",

    "content": "down now this is not unlimited which means I can remove up to one and a half",

    "content": "have three layers we have the wood the plaster and the stumps to make the",

  {
    "content": "out look a little bit of up and down up independent and then I make a little",

    "content": "crack correct with this foam being as denser than the pink it's a little bit",

  },
  {
    "content": "you want it you have this effect you can still achieve it yes so I have a base",

    "content": "and just so you know it's it's one piece I made an innocent incision two",
