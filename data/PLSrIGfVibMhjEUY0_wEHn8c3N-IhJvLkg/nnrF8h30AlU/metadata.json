This was a rapid fire craft where I was on a very limited time constraint. This time constraint led to a liberating experience of rapid experimentation that led to some very cool results.\n\nThis video was NOT sponsored by Absolute Tabletop, I'm just a friend and fan. If you want to check out this adventure kit you can do so here:\nhttps://absolutetabletop.com/shadows-over-driftchapel-adventure-kit-print-and-pdf\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n➳  http://www.blackmagiccraft.ca\n➳ Facebook: https://goo.gl/hvNgQL\n➳ Join the Tabletop Crafters Guild: https://goo.gl/RMMqoh",
