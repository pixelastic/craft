While there is no cure for this, there are several small things I've found I can do in order to mitigate the effects of shaky hands while trying to tackle miniature hobby projects like painting.\n\nIf you found this video helpful you need to check out the one put up by @Terrainosaur . Mitch has Parkinson's and has shared his own experiences and what does and doesn't work for him. There is a lot of other ideas and thoughts that I didn't cover in my video, so it may be exactly what you need. He's also hoping to raise funds for Parkinsons research. This is something that is also very personal to me as my mother in law has been recently diagnosed with the disease. It is quite a scary diagnosis and I'm really grateful people like Mitch are willing to talk about and share their experience with the disease and how it affects him as a hobbyist. https://youtu.be/oqp76vAJu9g\n\nGrab some bulk bulk detail brushes:\n(As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases)\n\n(USA) https://amzn.to/3hx0gDd\n(Canada) https://amzn.to/32sRekr\n(UK) https://amzn.to/3grFgfN\n(Germany) https://amzn.to/34yzUgk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n➳  http://www.blackmagiccraft.ca\n➳ Facebook: https://goo.gl/hvNgQL\n➳ Join the Tabletop Crafters Guild: https://goo.gl/RMMqoh",
