    "content": "to go that bright on it but this is gonna highlight all the edges and it's",

    "content": "going to give it that kind of gray weathered look and of course like",

  {
    "content": "doing this there's two things you to keep in mind one",

    "content": "so work off a lot of that excess paint and go lightly and carefully at first",

  },
  {
    "content": "because too much of this will actually look kind of strange the other nice",

  },
  {
    "content": "thing though is that because this color is a very similar just darker to this",
    "start": 440

  {
    "content": "stucco tan it doesn't matter if you get any of this onto the stucco so you don't",

  {
    "content": "fairly minimal and light so you just you know highlight the the grain but when",

  {
    "content": "you get to the actual edges any hard corners you can let that go on a bit",
    "start": 465

    "content": "heavier and that'll really highlight these edges and give it a look a little",

  {
    "content": "bit more 3d pop to it so I'm just gonna finish dry brushing this all out because",

  {
    "content": "it's basically just that and we'll skip ahead to the next step now all this wood",

  {
    "content": "has been highlighted with the dry brush it's all weathered looking and before I",

    "content": "do the washes now I'm going to paint out these details so I got a few different",

    "content": "figured this might have a nice kind of straw color to it it's very difficult to",

    "content": "move this around and paint it so that it all stays in frame so bear with me and I",

  {
    "content": "these little spots where I missed definitely don't want to get any of this",

    "content": "transferring onto the wood timbers but yeah that looks pretty good",

    "content": "a blue speckling like it was a toothbrush or a paintbrush but it's",
    "start": 580

    "content": "closer to me off-camera to get done alright so now that those are actually",

  {
    "content": "painted out I think it looks pretty cool probably pretty small on camera so you",
    "start": 606
  },
  {
    "content": "can't see it'll show better in the pictures now and try this flesh tone on",
    "start": 610

    "content": "this fungi now I don't really know if this will be appropriate I'm just going",
    "start": 617
  },
  {
    "content": "to experiment a bit and try it I think what I'm gonna do is paint these out",

  {
    "content": "flesh tone and then highlight the edges with a line of white",
    "start": 626

    "content": "as opposed to actually painting it on like like this when possible the reason",
