I touch on the issues of scale, proportion, and dimension in terrain building. \n\nMostly I just try to imply that you shouldn't spend much time worrying about this stuff and you should spend more time simply building, even if things end up a little screwed up.\n\n\n➳  http://www.blackmagiccraft.ca\n\n➳ Facebook: https://goo.gl/hvNgQL\n\n➳ Join the Tabletop Crafters Guild: https://goo.gl/RMMqoh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground music:\nKevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",
