  },
  {
    "content": "cut this out so here I'll start cutting and I'll fall",

    "content": "on my line so I get a thin strip and like I say or you be careful with this",

    "content": "you'll get like the cutting is a little harder so you might you might get some",

  {
    "content": "edges that you can just need to need to measure to cut off so don't do don't get",

  },
  {
    "content": "too crazy because you don't want to make change the shape too much from the wall",
    "start": 463
  },
  {
    "content": "you cut out just if you've got some little snags cut those off and so we",
    "start": 467
  },
  {
    "content": "should be getting good now one thing you might be thinking is oh well I cut the",
    "start": 474
  },
  {
    "content": "exterior it's not going to fit on the tile",
    "start": 479
  },
  {
    "content": "well for one thing the cardboard flexes so in a way it will but what you want to",
    "start": 481
  },
  {
    "content": "do is you want to cut it in half and depend on how big the tile is you may",
    "start": 489
  },
  {
    "content": "want to cut it more than that so we'll kind of measure we'll kind of",
    "start": 496
  },
  {
    "content": "put it on there and see it goes on the edge so what we'll do is we'll mark the",
    "start": 500
  },
  {
    "content": "end so we know where it glue to do is remove that and then glue",

  {
    "content": "all the way up to Primark and then down there want to make sure that it's on the",
    "start": 521

  {
    "content": "tile now it's okay if it hangs over the edge somewhat it won't be it'll be a",
    "start": 535
  },
  {
    "content": "little bit over the edge unlike a regular dungeon tile so there we go we",
    "start": 541
  },
  {
    "content": "have the first strip on so now here I'm going to put the second",
    "start": 548
  },
  {
    "content": "strip on I've already glued but you'll notice see that that overlaps so I want",

  {
    "content": "to cut a little business off because I'm making it it's smaller than it",
    "start": 561
  },
  {
    "content": "originally was okay so I've got that now once I get all the walls on I like",
    "start": 566
  },
  {
    "content": "to reinforce reinforces as with regular shapes they generally hang over the edge",
    "start": 597
  },
  {
    "content": "so I turn it over and I'll just take my glue gun and kind of anything any edges",

  {
    "content": "going up hanging over I'll just reinforce it put some glue keep it from",

    "content": "coming off later now another technique I like to do which",

  },
  {
    "content": "kind of simulates that this is a rough-hewn cave is I like to take the",
    "start": 629
  },
  {
    "content": "glue gun and glue put some extra glue on this now just drag your tip through it",
    "start": 633

    "content": "and it will give it kind of a rough texture and when you put the paint on",
    "start": 645

    "content": "that'll really look good it'll look like it's a rough hewn wall and I'll use this",

  },
  {
    "content": "technique on a lot of other water for example it looks it works great for",
    "start": 658
  },
  {
    "content": "water so then you just go around and just keep filling in till you get the",
    "start": 663
  },
  {
    "content": "whole wall done very easy to do okay so I've lined the tile with the",
    "start": 671
  },
  {
    "content": "glue gun and I'll bring it in closer so you can",
    "start": 684
  },
  {
    "content": "kind of see that texture and that'll look really nice when we paint it it'll",
    "start": 686
  },
  {
    "content": "make it giving it a regular texture and make it later look natural or rough-hewn",
    "start": 692
  },
  {
    "content": "so that's kind of our tile so far so but I'd also like to add another feature to",
    "start": 698
  },
  {
    "content": "the tile I was thinking for the for the story behind the cave there's a sinkhole",
    "start": 705

  {
    "content": "that the adventurers have to go further into so there might be an encounter in",
    "start": 712
  },
  {
    "content": "the outer part in this part here and then they have to go to a lower part so",
    "start": 716
  },
  {
    "content": "basically instead of attaching this tile to another one they would go down the",
    "start": 720
  },
  {
    "content": "sinkhole and then I would have a whole nother tile up there that they go into",
    "start": 727
  },
  {
    "content": "so there's an easy way to do that so what I'll do is I'll use the pen and",
    "start": 730
  },
  {
    "content": "I'll draw with a hole will be so what I'll do now is I'll just cut",
    "start": 736
  },
  {
    "content": "that out so now you can see that I've got the",
    "start": 750
  },
  {
    "content": "hole cut so that will be the sinkhole and then what I'm going to do is put a",
    "start": 758
  },
  {
    "content": "bottom on it so but I don't like to use the regular thickness of cardboard",
    "start": 763
  },
  {
    "content": "because then it'll lift up the title so what I'd like to use is some kind of",

  {
    "content": "cardstock you could use a cereal box you could use this is the back of a notepad",
    "start": 770

  {
    "content": "anything like that so what I'm going to do to get the size of it as I'm going to",
    "start": 776
  },
  {
    "content": "trace under the around the sink hole so I kind of know big it is and then I'll",

  {
    "content": "just trace an edge around and then I'll cut that out and we'll glue it on to the",
