  {
    "content": "see how I do that later in the video so I'm just gonna trace around the door and",

  {
    "content": "then measure out a half an inch from the door and then I will pull it up I'm",

  {
    "content": "going to measure make the door three inches tall and then I'll cut it off at",

    "content": "quarter inch cut or eighth inch card stock sorry and I'm using my hot glue",

    "content": "excess off okay so there we go okay now I want to do some detail on this door",
