    "content": "that's coming up from the slime and so you can add you can add more of those so",

    "content": "I'm gonna repaint I'm gonna repaint the slime so that's why I'm doing these",

    "content": "first I don't have to be that careful about getting on the edge of these",

    "content": "pieces that way it'll make it easier when I do the slime so kind of nice to",

    "content": "think about when you're doing projects to think about the order of the projects",

  {
    "content": "more of this with a thinner brush while this is wet that way I can add some of",

    "content": "hunter green alright that's looking pretty slimy but",
