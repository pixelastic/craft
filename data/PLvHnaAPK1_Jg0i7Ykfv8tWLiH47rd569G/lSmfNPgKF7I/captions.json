    "content": "then I'll move on to the next step now that's drier I can pick",

  },
  {
    "content": "texture to the base just like it does for the cables",
    "start": 454
  },

  },
  {
    "content": "strings hanging off of it and everything but you can see it has some very texture",

  },
  {
    "content": "that and then we'll come back here's my base painted base front and",

  {
    "content": "center so I've got the ice shards coming out and then I've got the base the",

  },
  {
    "content": "textured base so it's all painted white so what I'm going to do is I want to",
    "start": 538
  },
  {
    "content": "kind of give it like an ice look so what I'm going to do is use a blue paint",

  {
    "content": "called a Caribbean and it's it's almost an aqua blue I'm get my brush very wet",

  },
  {
    "content": "right now it's going to seem to blue but that's fine because we'll add some more",
    "start": 582
  },
  {
    "content": "white to it so there we go so we'll let that dry and then we'll move on now if I",

  },
  {
    "content": "was doing all these at once I'm just showing you one base but ideally you",

  },
  {
    "content": "want to paint all the bases at the same time so you do this stage for each base",

  },
  {
    "content": "at the same time that way it's kind of like an assembly line",
    "start": 610
  },
  {
    "content": "okay so we'll let that dry wait and then go to the next step",

  },
  {
    "content": "here's our little marker base it's looking pretty blue right now but it is",
    "start": 625
  },
  {
    "content": "dry so our next step is going to be I'm going to dry brush it so I'm just going",
    "start": 630
  },
  {
    "content": "to take the brush and not wet it use it dry and just get some white paint on the",
    "start": 635
  },
  {
    "content": "brush and then I will start gently the whites is a very thin color so what I'm",
    "start": 640
  },
  {
    "content": "going to do is I'm going to paint it on there let that dry a little bit and then",
    "start": 675
  },
  {
    "content": "paint some more white on now here's our our vase now one thing we",
    "start": 680
  },
  {
    "content": "can do to add a little bit of extra oomph to this is you can use some",
    "start": 695
  },
  {
    "content": "pearlescent paint and this is a very thin paint it just adds kind of a sheen",
    "start": 702
  },
  {
    "content": "a sparkly Sheen to an object there's not really there very teeny sparkles there's",
    "start": 709
  },
  {
    "content": "not it's not like a glitter type thing but it adds a nice Sheen to thing so",
    "start": 716
  },
  {
    "content": "which would be good for this since it's supposed to be ice so we'll get some on",
    "start": 724
  },
  {
    "content": "the just paint it right on it's very thin so it doesn't really color the",
    "start": 728
  },
  {
    "content": "object much it just adds that Sheen so here we go take a look at that",
    "start": 738

  {
    "content": "one piece for the center of the ice storm so it can be up to 20 squares away",

    "content": "show you so the wizard has a twenty range and he's easily that's easily",

  },
  {
    "content": "much area to slow down the zombies as possible so he going to put it there and",
    "start": 828
  },
  {
    "content": "so anywhere three out from that will be the radius of the storm so I'll do three",

  {
    "content": "out here and then three out here and then here",
    "start": 847

  {

    "content": "circular radius around this would be where the ice term would be so anybody",

    "content": "moves into that these initial zombies are hit and anybody else who moves into",
    "start": 873
  },
  {
    "content": "that would be in the zone of effect so that's you know that's how you measure",

  {
    "content": "spells it's very easy to do you know I didn't use some special template or",
