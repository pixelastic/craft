  {

  {
    "content": "gray to the sponge now I could just dip it in the grey but I think it'll easier",

  {
    "content": "to do it this way and you get it all over the sponge so now I will move my",
    "start": 169
  },
  {
    "content": "plate out of the way and then you can just start dabbing the tile and see",
    "start": 175
  },
  {
    "content": "that's how that's adding a really nice stony texture to that tile",
    "start": 187
  },
  {
    "content": "so yeah that's going they go back over some of the other areas get the corners",
    "start": 196
  },
  {
    "content": "so now I'm going to put some more paint on there start to",

    "content": "now remember when you're done with this you're going to want to wash out the",

  },
  {
    "content": "sponge because the paint will dry and ruin the sponge if you want to use it",
    "start": 264
  },
  {
    "content": "again so make sure you do that so now we've got the first coat on there and",
    "start": 268
  },
  {
    "content": "what I'm going to do is I'm going to let that dry and then I'm going to add a",
    "start": 273
  },
  {
    "content": "lighter coat to give some more variation to the tile itself so we'll let that dry",
    "start": 276
  },
  {
    "content": "and wash out our sponge and then we'll come back for the next step",
    "start": 281
  },
  {
    "content": "so this was quick just drive within minutes and now I'm back with the the",
    "start": 294
  },
  {
    "content": "second coat I'm gonna do a lighter gray and I just rushed that on the the sponge",
    "start": 299
  },
  {
    "content": "like I did with the darker color so now I'll start just applying it to the title",
    "start": 306
  },
  {
    "content": "so you're getting in a lighter lighter areas and then you can do the edge",
    "start": 314
  },
  {
    "content": "okay so now I've got that so what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to take my",

  },
  {
    "content": "brush and kind of dip it into the paint a little bit I'm just going to do a",

  },
  {
    "content": "little little bit like that just add some more variation so now we'll let",

  },
  {
    "content": "that dry and we'll move on to the next step",
    "start": 374
  },
  {
    "content": "now the good thing with this technique is it's a lot cheaper than the spray",
    "start": 385
  },
  {
    "content": "paint the bad thing is it doesn't give it kind of a hard shell that the other",

  },
  {
    "content": "texture paint does also it's much more time consuming than the texture paint",
    "start": 393
  },
  {
    "content": "but if you're on a budget and you have the time this is a great method to do",

  },
  {
    "content": "now I'm going to kind of finish out the tile add some more detail like I",
    "start": 405
  },
  {
    "content": "normally do so I'm going to use my brush get some black very watered-down black",
    "start": 409
  },
  {
    "content": "and then go around the edges it's better to put a to light than too too dark",
    "start": 415

  {
    "content": "because you can always you can always add some dark to it but you just it's a",
    "start": 427
  },
  {
    "content": "lot harder to add there there we go okay now I want to add",

    "content": "a little a few little scuffs and stuff this is gonna be a an older dungeon and",

    "content": "scuffs and just using the tips of the brush just to get some little scuff you",

    "content": "can also remember this looks kind of glassy now but it will it'll dart it'll",
    "start": 465
  },
  {
    "content": "lighten somewhat or it won't be glossy because it'll dry there you got some",
    "start": 475
  },
  {
    "content": "nice texture on that so I'm gonna let that dry for a sec and",
    "start": 488
  },
  {
    "content": "then I'll do a little little little finish up here",
    "start": 501
  },
  {
    "content": "so that just dried within minutes so check that out now I'm going to do a",
    "start": 517
  },
  {
    "content": "little extra detail I'm gonna do the edging so it kind of pops out so I'm",

    "content": "using my light gray just getting it on my chisel brush and I'm just pulling on",

  {
    "content": "illusion that the walls are taller than they actually are the shadow and the",

  },
  {
    "content": "highlight and you can even use smaller scopes if you want but there we go so",

  },
  {
    "content": "we've got a finished tile didn't use any texture paint on it but gave it a easy",
    "start": 568

  {
    "content": "way to give it the texture just use the sponge and paint the gray on it",
    "start": 574
  },
  {
    "content": "dab it on then dab the lighter and then just add some details with a brush and",
    "start": 581
  },
  {
    "content": "you're good to go so like I say this technique will take longer than the",
    "start": 588
  },
  {
    "content": "texture paint and if you spray it it kind of gives it like a plastic coat",
    "start": 593
  },
  {
    "content": "that makes it a little a little more sturdy this is still fine though so this",
    "start": 598
  },
  {
    "content": "is that you can do this instead but yeah for those people who are looking for a",
    "start": 606
  },
  {
    "content": "cheaper way to do it or just don't have access to the texture paint this is a",
    "start": 610
  },
  {
    "content": "great substitute for doing these kind of dungeon tiles and also keep in mind that",

  {
    "content": "if you do the dirt tunnels like I have shown before that I have done some of",

  },
  {
    "content": "those you can just use the brown so use a brown paint the tile black use a brown",

  },
  {
    "content": "the dark Browns first and then use a lighter brown on top of it and you'll",
    "start": 629
  },
  {
    "content": "get that same kind of texture look so there we go and thanks for joining me on",
