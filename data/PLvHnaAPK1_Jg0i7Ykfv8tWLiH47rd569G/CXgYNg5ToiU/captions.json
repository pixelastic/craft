    "content": "and kind of dirty it up kind of get the corner the edges",

  {
    "content": "little bit of highlight and a little bit of shadow so I'm just using a very light",

    "content": "gray and black so I'm going to do what's called a dry brush technique so I get a",

  {
    "content": "little bit of my little bit of paint on the brush like that and then just kind",

  {
    "content": "highlighting that edge so it's kind of standing out a little better",

  {
    "content": "makes the edge pop so now I'm going to add a little bit of shadow so I want to",
    "start": 575
  },
  {
    "content": "do kind of the opposite I don't want a dry brush I want to wet the paint so",
    "start": 579

  {
    "content": "it's very wet and fairly thin and then I'm going to go",

    "content": "so I go around the edge here feel the black is too light you can",

  {
    "content": "always add more you can kind of do some dings and net",

  {
    "content": "would really consider doing this and like I say it's super easy to implement",
