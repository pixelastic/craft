  {
    "content": "that wood piece in there now I do want to add a little more strength and detail",

  },
  {
    "content": "center and I'll just start adding some detail in there kind of doing like",

    "content": "swirls and then you can connect it on the bottom there to the edge so a little",
    "start": 346
  },
  {
    "content": "tricky to reach in there but alright so there's there's what we got so far so",
    "start": 358
  },
  {
    "content": "now I'm just going to start adding glue to the outside and this will give it",

  },
  {
    "content": "strict as well as texture and so I'll just start dragging that glue gun back",

    "content": "and forth you can fill in some of the gaps in the toilet paper with the glue",

  },
  {
    "content": "and kind of round out the edge so it's not a sharp edge and then I can just",
    "start": 384
  },
  {
    "content": "pull that into the other glue and it blends right in alright so now I work my",
    "start": 391
  },
  {
    "content": "way around I also do some of the inside and then we'll come back and go to the",

  },
  {
    "content": "applying that on there and you're not gonna see much of a difference here",
    "start": 486

  {
    "content": "because it's dark brown and starting out with black so so I'll just paint the",
