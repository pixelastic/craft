  {
    "content": "the rest of the edging or on the canyon and I'll let it dry and then we'll move",

  {
    "content": "make some stairs that come up like this and so I'll put these together now one",

  },
  {
    "content": "thing that's a little different than these stairs that I do with the other is",

  },

    "content": "I would generally make the first stair as long as I wanted the stairway to be",

  },

    "content": "and then the other stairs would sit on top of it and they would be they would",
    "start": 588
  },
  {
    "content": "be gradually shorter and shorter and shorter but there would be a base to the",
    "start": 592
  },
  {
    "content": "stair for the stairs to sit on in this instance I'm putting the gonna put these",
    "start": 597
  },
  {
    "content": "on top of each other but there won't be a base underneath to hold these up well",
    "start": 601
  },
  {
    "content": "that's going to be fine because the edge of the ravine there has some height so",
    "start": 608
  },
  {
    "content": "this will help bridge that gap so now I've got these pieces now one thing I",
    "start": 614
  },
  {
    "content": "want to do is I want to make them look kind of like an ancient stairway",
    "start": 626
  },
  {
    "content": "that's been around a while so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my",
    "start": 630
  },
  {
    "content": "scissors and I'm going to trim them a little bit so I'm gonna kind of round",
    "start": 635
  },
  {
    "content": "out the edges a little bit make them a little bit irregular",
    "start": 643
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm not so worried about the back edge because this will be underneath the",
    "start": 655
  },
  {
    "content": "other pieces but this arrow is where the front will be so I'm going to kind of",
    "start": 658
  },
  {
    "content": "make it and I'll do that for all the pieces so now when I stack these I've",
    "start": 664
  },
  {
    "content": "already marked where I'm going to have each stair an inch I've already marked",
    "start": 676
  },
  {
    "content": "that so when I stack each of these you see how they look a little bit of",
    "start": 678
  },
  {
    "content": "regular they don't look straight so they look like worn stone which will really",
    "start": 686
  },
  {
    "content": "fit my purpose and so we'll do is with glow that will glue that stairway",
    "start": 692
  },
  {
    "content": "together and then I'll move on to the next step",
    "start": 699
  },
  {
    "content": "all right because I've got my stairs and I'll glue those together so just line up",
    "start": 707
  },
  {
    "content": "with that mark and that's about an inch there okay",
    "start": 722
  },
  {
    "content": "so I've got my steroid nut and you can see how it falls over because it doesn't",
    "start": 742

  {
    "content": "have any support underneath but that'll be fine because it's gonna go hit the",
    "start": 746
  },
  {
    "content": "lip of the ravine there or the core loss so I'm gonna glue the bridge to this and",
    "start": 749
  },
  {
    "content": "I'll show you how that works with the with the actual edge of the tile",
    "start": 757
  },
  {
    "content": "now here I've got my ravine all the flocking is dried so that's all on there",
    "start": 769
  },
  {
    "content": "now the scenario is going to entail a drawbridge if the players have to get",
    "start": 776
  },
  {
    "content": "across so I'm going to do is I'm going to have two pieces of the draw bit or",
    "start": 781
  },
  {
    "content": "two pieces of the platform of the bridge on each side and then a drawbridge that",
    "start": 785
  },
  {
    "content": "comes down so I'm going to do that is I'm going to take the stairs that I made",
    "start": 789
  },
  {
    "content": "and I'm gonna glue a bridge piece a straight bridge piece on it and I've",
    "start": 793
  },
  {
    "content": "marked the piece here so I know where to glue so I'll go ahead and do that",
    "start": 797
  },
  {
    "content": "so now as I mentioned I did the stairs without the backing on the bottom there",
    "start": 819
  },
  {
    "content": "so that they can come up over the edge of the ravine and then I've made another",
    "start": 826
  },
  {
    "content": "piece that will go on the other side so that's the basic setup I've got stairs",
    "start": 832
  },
  {
    "content": "steps going up to the bridge would be a drawbridge piece that comes down and",
    "start": 840
  },
  {
    "content": "connects the two bridges and that's how the scenario is gonna play out so now I",
    "start": 846
  },
  {
    "content": "will move on to the next step you",
