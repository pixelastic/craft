    "content": "could use these for futuristic tiles steampunk tiles dark future or you know",

    "content": "it's it's really easy embellishment to add to the tiles so let's go to the",

    "content": "material we're going to use for this besides our normal things are the screen",

    "content": "mesh okay this is just a fiberglass screen mesh and I got 5 feet of this at",

    "content": "the hardware store if this is a black and it's repeat wide and it cost me 5",
    "start": 89

  {
    "content": "bucks to get this so this is a lot of mesh to make a lot of tiles with okay so",
    "start": 95
  },
  {
    "content": "now the trick is what we're going to do is we want to make metal plating on",

  {
    "content": "these tiles and the mesh can really help with that it can give a really good look",
    "start": 110
  },
  {
    "content": "to that so what I'm going to do with the mesh is I'm going to roll it over the",
    "start": 114
  },
  {
    "content": "tiles and then I'm going to roughly cut it to the shape of the tile and then",
    "start": 120

  {
    "content": "we'll we'll proceed from there but remember that you could do it over the",

    "content": "tile but it can be hard to trim right up to the edge so I do recommend that you",
    "start": 134
  },
  {
    "content": "cut it the size of the tile it's pretty easy you can just put this under the",
    "start": 139
  },
  {
    "content": "mesh and cut it with your scissors so I'll go",
    "start": 143
  },

    "content": "notice the mesh tends to buck a little bit and what I like to do is is secure",

    "content": "it down to the surface and what you can do with that is you can just use some",
    "start": 165
  },
  {
    "content": "white glue and I'm going to get it where I want it on the tile and then just",
    "start": 169
  },
  {
    "content": "start adding some white glue to it this is a nice technique you might say why go",
    "start": 176
  },
  {
    "content": "to those trouble this is a nice technique it keeps the screen from",
    "start": 191
  },
  {
    "content": "buckling and so then just kind of smear the blue into the screen and believe me",
    "start": 193
  },
  {
    "content": "when this dries you won't even see this glue it just we will totally disappear",
    "start": 199
  },
  {
    "content": "but it'll keep this screen very secured down to the to the tile itself all right",
    "start": 203
  },
  {
    "content": "when you start doing the hot glue and stuff it can buckle the screen and then",
    "start": 211
  },
  {
    "content": "you're done because you can't model you know it's already glued the bowls down",
    "start": 215
  },
  {
    "content": "so this way you've got the screen all flat against the tile right before you",
    "start": 219

  {
    "content": "start so it's another step but it'll save you a lot of heartache in the end",
    "start": 224
  },
  {
    "content": "so now I'm going to do the top the the hallway tile and then after we would do",
    "start": 228
  },
  {
    "content": "that okay I would glue the walls down like normal so I'll take my wall strip",
    "start": 237
  },
  {
    "content": "and then glue it down you know leave room space for your doors and everything",
    "start": 242
  },
  {
    "content": "now another step I do is I use cardstock okay and this is quarter-inch cut and",
    "start": 245
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm going to put it on these lines that I've got going on the on the tile itself",
    "start": 252
  },
  {
    "content": "so I'll put one there and then one there and you'll see how that works out when I",
    "start": 259

  {
    "content": "apply where when I show you the tile it's also what I'm going to do is I'm",

  {
    "content": "going to bring out the top the completed tile and show you what it looks like",
    "start": 268

  {
    "content": "so here we go here's our completed tile and you can see how how nice that looks",
    "start": 284

  {
    "content": "okay so a few strains on there so I put the walls on like I would with the",
    "start": 291
  },
  {
    "content": "normal tile after I've got the mesh the mesh dried I put the walls on like a",
    "start": 299
  },
  {
    "content": "normally would then I added this card stock to where I had the lines I also",
    "start": 303
  },
  {
    "content": "had a little bits of card stock on the edge where the lines met the wall and",
    "start": 309
  },
  {
    "content": "this is this not only helps hold the mesh down which it's already pretty well",
    "start": 315
  },
  {
    "content": "held down but it gives it that decking look look it looks like a deck metal",
    "start": 321

  {
    "content": "deck so now let me grab this other tile here and you can see it's a hallway and",

  {
    "content": "I did the exact same thing I just had the the card stock at certain intervals",

    "content": "can go crazy from there you can really modify it from there so I will go back I",

    "content": "will go ahead and paint these flat black and I will come back and paint these",
