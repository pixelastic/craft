  {
    "content": "be dry brushing so I'll just get the paint on the brush without any water and",

  {
    "content": "been that a little bit okay so now I've got a base here so what I could do is I",

  {
    "content": "could add more than one plant to this so say I put one here and one here one here",

    "content": "on this base and then I could just set this whole thing down as an area of like",

    "content": "next to a figure now the thing is one thing another thing I like about these",

  },
  {
    "content": "bases is they don't move as much because they're weighted down they have the they",
    "start": 692
  },
  {
    "content": "have the sand on them so they if it's just the cardstock they move much easier",
    "start": 696
  },
  {
    "content": "than this so they're they don't move around quite as much if you bump them so",
    "start": 700
  },
  {
    "content": "that's that's a nice little thing with those sandy bases and I think it looks",

  },
  {
    "content": "great and you can just plop those down on the battlefield and have some on some",

    "content": "light cover now I want to show you him what he looks like on the base that I",

  {
    "content": "one bonus to this also is if you glue these down then they won't move around",

  {
    "content": "battlefield that have light vegetation ie cover on them so or not just cover",
