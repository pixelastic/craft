  {
    "content": "more gray here ok so now we've got that so now what",
    "start": 576
  },
  {
    "content": "I'll do is I'll just start doing some of these rocks so what I'm going to just do",

    "content": "is pull over the rock and just kind of highlight it a bit and see how that's",

  {
    "content": "shade of the gray one thing you could also do that I'm not going to do today",

  {
    "content": "is you could add slime or moss to these stones and all you would have to do is",
    "start": 627
  },
  {
    "content": "just take a green and generally what I do is I take a darker green and just",
    "start": 635
  },
  {
    "content": "kind of stipple on the stone like this dip it in the green and then just",
    "start": 640
  },
  {
    "content": "stipple on the stone and then after that dries I take a lighter green and then",

    "content": "stipple it with that so it gives that some variation just doesn't look like a",
    "start": 647
  },
  {
    "content": "flat green that's a nice nice way to give it some interest and there we go we",

  {
    "content": "got that we'll let that dry for a second and then we'll move on to the next step",
    "start": 658

  {
    "content": "but look how look how nice that looks look how that really popped that stuff",

  {
    "content": "out gives a dimension the whole the whole trick of this technique is to",

    "content": "dimensional and painting doing the highlighting and darkening technique can",

  },
  {
    "content": "really give that dimension of depth so there we go and now we'll do the last",
    "start": 682

  {
    "content": "step and we'll finish up this top so here's our tile all dry and ready to",
    "start": 686

  {
    "content": "go the thing I just don't like about doing a water tile is that the water",

  {
    "content": "have to do but I like to do it it just adds that little extra cool factor to",
    "start": 711

  {
    "content": "water or liquids now what I use is I use a water-based varnish this is just put",
