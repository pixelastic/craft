  {
    "content": "works so and then I have one with nothing on it and which is still very",

    "content": "to help them solve a puzzle so they come in there they're looking",

  },
  {
    "content": "make intelligence checks so and then you can make the check harder as they want",
    "start": 973
  },
  {
    "content": "more clues so you might have a couple clues on hand ready and then that you",

  {
    "content": "feel appropriate and as a DM and then when they make the first check you know",
    "start": 984
  },
  {
    "content": "make it make it a medium maybe and then maybe maybe a hard you know and then you",
    "start": 989

  {
    "content": "know then they have to figure it out from there so so when they get in the",

    "content": "timer starts you say we had the dial on the clock and the clock has this dial on",

  {
    "content": "out what settings to put the dial on at particular points when solving the writ",

    "content": "to dial each globe and each globe represents the Sun and this represents",

    "content": "they have to get behind the globe with a light source to shine like like a Sun",
