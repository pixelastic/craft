  {
    "content": "the PCs are so they got to move through it or whatever so yeah that's that's one",
    "start": 294
  },
  {
    "content": "great thing that you could that's one easy thing you could do to make the",
    "start": 299
  },
  {
    "content": "encounter more interesting another thing you could do is obscure site so maybe",
    "start": 303
  },
  {
    "content": "that same COBOL throws a smoke bomb and it bursts in front of the player",

  },
  {
    "content": "actions that it only lasts until the start of the next round so that's great",

  },
  {
    "content": "goes away at the end of the round plus you have to use different ones",
    "start": 345

  {
    "content": "right that's kind of in the rules you have to use different different types of",
    "start": 349
  },
  {
    "content": "layer actions so you can't keep using the same layer action at them and this",
    "start": 353
  },
  {
    "content": "just gets really annoying you have to use different ones so that's another one",

  },
  {
    "content": "so another one could be snaring something comes out the snare the",

  },
  {
    "content": "swings or whatever and you could you know minor earthquake or something like",
    "start": 391
  },
  {
    "content": "that and you could cause you know the players to have to roll to see if they",
    "start": 395

    "content": "they lose a lot of options as far as where they can position themselves for",
