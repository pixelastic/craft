    "content": "I've cut a piece of cardboard this is a thin thinner cardboard it is one inch",

  {
    "content": "to have a little bit of an overhang right so it's about good I'll just cut",

  {
    "content": "I cut so I'm just going to wet it up squeeze out most of the water okay and",

  {
    "content": "then pull it back out so what I want to do is apply this to the the bed itself",
    "start": 414
  },
  {
    "content": "so what I'm going to do is get my finger first I'm going to do is put some glue",

  },
  {
    "content": "on here this will get the the base going and then I'm going to drape it over here",

    "content": "that's a little long on there though I'm going to cut a little bit of that off I",

    "content": "think so now what I'm going to do is put some",
    "start": 450
  },
  {
    "content": "blue on the sides here and then you can bend that down now it's kind of because",

  {
    "content": "it does give a little bit of relief but it's kind of boring that way it doesn't",
    "start": 472

  {
    "content": "look as you know interesting so what I like to do is kind of fold it back so",

  },
  {
    "content": "take the top here just kind of fold it back and you can put some more glue on",
    "start": 481
  },
  {
    "content": "there and then just kind of fold it don't be afraid to make it a little",
    "start": 488
  },
  {
    "content": "rough because the more you stick it up the more kind of relief it's going to",
    "start": 499
  },
  {
    "content": "have so you can kind of pull it up a bit or make it like that",
    "start": 505

    "content": "okay so I'll play with that a little bit and then we'll move on to the next step",

  {
    "content": "all right so I've got that how I like it and it looks pretty good so what you can",

  },
  {
    "content": "do is while this is drying you can take a little piece of cardboard and put it",
    "start": 537
  },
  {
    "content": "underneath it and that kind of lifts it up okay so now I'm taking another square",
    "start": 540
  },
  {
    "content": "of the paper towel I'm going to wet it and this is going to be the pillow okay",
    "start": 546
  },
  {
    "content": "okay so now that I have that untangled what I can do is kind of roll it up",
    "start": 563
  },
  {
    "content": "all right so I end up with something like that okay so now I'm going to cut",
    "start": 590

  {
    "content": "it because that's pretty large pillow there",
    "start": 596
  },
  {
    "content": "all right so we've got a nice pillow so now all we do is add some glue stick",
