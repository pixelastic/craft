  {
    "content": "gonna do is I'm just gonna paint this black with spray this base black and",
    "start": 173
  },
  {
    "content": "then paint it with the texture paint so it'll match the tile so and then I will",

  {
    "content": "gonna take the hot glue gun and I'm gonna put some texture on this gate you",

  {
    "content": "into the center and then taper off hope you can see this here so this will give",
    "start": 252
  },
  {
    "content": "kind of a neat effect it'll give actually some relief when I paint it I'm",
    "start": 266
  },
  {
    "content": "also going to do some in-between lines a little smaller",
    "start": 275

  {
    "content": "move on to the next step now and you see this gate you'll notice",

  {
    "content": "that unlike most pieces that I paint I've actually started",

  },
  {
    "content": "well negate it's kind of like a luminescent object so I I find it better",

  {
    "content": "to start from a place of white of light as opposed to dark so that's why I've",

  {
    "content": "kind of accentuate that is I'm going to use a light Inka gold this will not only",
    "start": 492

  {
    "content": "bring some interesting color into it it'll also it's it's metallic so it'll",

    "content": "add like a sheen to this gate and make it look magical to see how those raised",

  },
  {
    "content": "magical gate so see a little closer there so you can see the effect I'll",
    "start": 542

    "content": "base is just that card stock and I painted it with the texture the brown",

  {
    "content": "for a few seconds and voila we have our arcade now with the gate you",

  {
    "content": "glitter on there that's something you could do I'm not gonna do that with this",

  {
    "content": "gate but if you wanted to maybe you could do that so here I'm gonna grab my",

  {
    "content": "kind of the idea of this gate that the players have to figure out how to get",
