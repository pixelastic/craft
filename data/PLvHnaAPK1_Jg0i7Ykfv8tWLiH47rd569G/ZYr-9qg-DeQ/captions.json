    "content": "today I'm going to show you how to quick and easy we can make these mats so let's",

  {
    "content": "go to table and crank those out hey guys here is our material and the first thing",
    "start": 38

  {
    "content": "you could use is this foam from the craft store and the nice thing about",

    "content": "this is it's already black so you wouldn't have to paint it ok now another",

  {
    "content": "one that I have painted flat black and it's ready to go for the next step I",

    "content": "they're easy to push on the table because they have enough weight they do",
    "start": 73

    "content": "texture are these foam core sheets ok now I got this at the Dollar Tree I like",

    "content": "these because they're a dollar but on top of that what I like best about these",

    "content": "go and got that foam side in the paper side",
    "start": 119
  },

    "content": "four by four square okay and what the one side is the foam",
    "start": 128

  {
    "content": "sharp box cutter now you want to make sure your box cutter sharp because the",

  {
    "content": "foam can tear up very easily it does help cutting on the paper side",

  {
    "content": "these blocks now this will help me when I do the stone texture so I'm going to",

    "content": "there you go I didn't want to do you don't want to do too much but a little",

  {
    "content": "bit is nice so I filled it all in you can see it's ready to go now I need to",

  {
    "content": "make it so that the stones look like they're curving in on the edges so I'm",

    "content": "where it and the stones meet ok and so I've got that all done and that",

  {
    "content": "gives a nice curve to those stones on the very ends there all right now I'm",

    "content": "just going to use a simple butter knife and cut out this grid I'm cutting down",

  {
    "content": "detail on the stone so I'm just going to use the end of the butter knife and just",

  },
  {
    "content": "poke it into the foam core and that will give a nice definition to those stones",
    "start": 245
  },

    "content": "and just I'll just keep doing that until I fill out the whole piece ok",

  },
  {
    "content": "you can also bang out a little bit with the butter knife to give it some more",

  },
  {
    "content": "there you go now finish up those stones they're all finished now the problem",
    "start": 264
  },
  {
    "content": "with this is that it'd be very hard to stamp in the weight and the as it is",
    "start": 270
  },
  {
    "content": "because it's flexible so that would be make it hard to stamp on the mats so",
    "start": 274
  },
  {
    "content": "what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a piece of cardboard that I made two",

  },
  {
    "content": "layers of cardboard and then a couple layers for the handle and I'm just going",
    "start": 282
  },
  {
    "content": "to hot glue that on to this so I'm gonna glue the paper site on okay and then I",

  },
  {
    "content": "will have a very nice stamp ready to go so I can get the texture on those mats",
    "start": 293

  },
  {
    "content": "just start brushing this on okay I want to give a generous coat and you can dab",
    "start": 315
  },
  {
    "content": "some of the other colors to give it variation and it'll just line it up on",
    "start": 321
  },
  {
    "content": "the map and stamp it and then do it again now as you progress you'll notice",
    "start": 326
  },
  {
    "content": "that you get more paint on the stamp and you can actually stamp it twice right",
    "start": 331
  },
  {
    "content": "the early stages you pretty much have to do it one Stamper per load but as you",
    "start": 337
  },
  {
    "content": "get later into the into the piece or you do more of these at once though the the",
    "start": 341
  },
  {
    "content": "thing will be loaded up and you'll be able to do a couple stamps at once okay",
    "start": 346
  },
  {
    "content": "I noticed I turn the the piece what I stamped it now if there are any little",
    "start": 350

  {
    "content": "black areas you don't like you can stamp in there with a brush just stipple on",

  {
    "content": "there basically to fill in some areas that were maybe a little uncovered when",
    "start": 358
  },
  {
    "content": "you did the stamp and now we can reuse a stamp so what I'm going to do is I'm",

  },
  {
    "content": "just going to hold it over the water and using my brush and paint on there now I",
    "start": 370
  },
  {
    "content": "want to get it on the cardboard so that's why I'm doing it this way and",
    "start": 375
  },
  {
    "content": "then I'll clear that off and it'll be ready for the next time so yeah there we",

    "content": "go and just dry it off and you'll be good for more stamps hey crafters I hope",
