  },
  {
    "content": "grab my base and then I've made three of these so what I'm going to do is kind of",

  },

  },
  {
    "content": "I'll go do is I will I'll go spray this black and that will",
    "start": 279

  {
    "content": "move to the painting phase so here's our base painted blocks and",

  },
  {
    "content": "you can see they look pretty good so now we're going to apply some grade to this",

  },
  {
    "content": "and I'm going to use a piece of a sponge I cut off so I can have a little bit of",

  },
  {
    "content": "a smaller shape and I'm just going to grab my gray off the plate right onto",

  {

  },
  {

  {
    "content": "move on to the next step my next step is going to be add some",

    "content": "rubble and some stone to this which I'm going to use the famous construction",

  {
    "content": "sand just all-purpose sand you can get at the the hardware store especially",
    "start": 351
  },
  {
    "content": "big-box stores now the reason I painted the gray before I put the the rubble in",
    "start": 360
  },
  {
    "content": "stand stones on is because I wanted to give that a base coat of the gray before",
    "start": 366
  },
  {
    "content": "I put it on because once I put the if I put the rubble on first and then tried",
    "start": 371
  },
  {
    "content": "to do it it would saturate into the rubble and it'd be all gray so I like",
    "start": 374
  },
  {
    "content": "having it dark so what I was doing is I'll put the rubble on put a black wash",
    "start": 378
  },
  {
    "content": "on it and then put the gray over it so I'm go ahead and put that on now so now",
    "start": 382
  },
  {
    "content": "I want to do some areas I think I'll do some by the stones and then out front",
    "start": 387
  },
  {
    "content": "and then around on the base give the base some texture alright so there we go",
    "start": 401
  },
  {
    "content": "I think I'm happy with that zombie is my plate to catch all the",
    "start": 411
  },
  {
    "content": "dropping extras make sure you get all of it and especially underneath the stones",
    "start": 418
  },
  {
    "content": "so just pile it up so it goes into that crevice there you can always just dump",
    "start": 426
  },
  {
    "content": "it back in here receptacle when you're done so alright we'll let that dry and",
    "start": 432
  },
  {
    "content": "then we'll be ready for the next step so here's my project so far I've got the",
    "start": 436
  },
  {
    "content": "stuff the stones painted with the gray and I put the rubble on which is this a",
    "start": 447
  },
  {
    "content": "construction sand and I showed you how I did that",
    "start": 453
  },
  {
    "content": "I just want to show you would look like after I took the the sand off the piece",
    "start": 456
  },
  {
    "content": "so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do stuff you've seen me do already I'm",
    "start": 460
  },
  {
    "content": "gonna paint the base like a dirt paint the rubble like the stone texture I will",
    "start": 464
  },
  {
    "content": "highlight the stone texture with lighter gray and I'm going to do one more",
    "start": 469
  },
  {
    "content": "technique that I haven't shown you before that will add some little extra",
    "start": 472
  },
  {
    "content": "oomph to this piece make it so make it interesting so I'll go ahead and paint",
    "start": 478
  },
  {
    "content": "this up and then we'll move on to that next technique",
    "start": 482
  },
  {
    "content": "all right so here's my finished painted piece it looks pretty nice looks like",
    "start": 492
  },
  {
    "content": "some old blocks stacked up on top of each other now I was talking about I",
    "start": 497
  },
  {
    "content": "want to do a technique that I haven't shown before and here's how we'll start",
    "start": 501
  },
  {
    "content": "it so I'm gonna remove this piece so we can talk about it now here I have an old",
    "start": 504
  },
  {
    "content": "brush you can see it's pretty beat-up and I'm gonna use this from my project",
    "start": 509
  },
  {
    "content": "so what I've done is I've got some green you paint just acrylic it's just the",
    "start": 512
  },
  {
    "content": "color is I think it's English you and so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take the",
    "start": 521
  },
  {
    "content": "brush dip it into the paint and just saturate that brush on here get that",
    "start": 526
  },
  {
    "content": "paint all in those bristles now instead of painting with this brush I am",
    "start": 533
  },
  {
    "content": "actually going to leave it to dry I'm gonna leave this brush to drive",
    "start": 546
  },
  {
    "content": "so we will we'll do that and then we'll come back",
    "start": 553
  },
  {
    "content": "here I have my drive brush and it's a it's a bit stiff but that's okay you can",
    "start": 563
  },
  {
    "content": "actually like kind of break them loosen up the bristles a bit so there we go so",
    "start": 568
  },
  {
    "content": "now I'm going to use just like grass on the terrain piece now",
    "start": 576
  },
  {
    "content": "the cool thing is you can have it as tall as you want you could cut it down",
    "start": 584
  },
  {
    "content": "here if you want a taller if you want a shorter you can cut it up here so what",
    "start": 587
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm going to do is just take kind of a tuft got my scissors and then so I have",
    "start": 591
  },
  {
    "content": "my tuft we can see that okay so now I will get a",
    "start": 603
  },
  {
    "content": "couple other toughs same way and I'm not making this full-length",
    "start": 611
  },
  {
    "content": "okay now I'm using the small I'm going to use a small glue gun and I'll pick a",
    "start": 617
  },
  {
    "content": "spot to put it tuft now one thing I like about this is that",
    "start": 625
  },
  {
    "content": "they don't take up a lot of space like some plants you put on are going to be",
    "start": 633
  },
  {
    "content": "especially the aquarium plants are going to be pushing out and taking up quite a",
    "start": 638
  },
  {
    "content": "bit of space but these don't take up that much space let's see if you can see",
    "start": 643
  },
  {
    "content": "that there it's not put a couple other words on",
    "start": 648
  },
  {
    "content": "okay so we got some nice grass on there grab those strings off the",
    "start": 658
  },
  {
    "content": "another thing I'm going to do is I'm going to add a little bit of roots on",
    "start": 670
  },
  {
    "content": "here I can do that with this small glue gun so I'm going to kind of go to where",
    "start": 675
  },
  {
    "content": "I did my plant and just put a little bit of and just kind of pull out",
    "start": 682
  },
  {
    "content": "and that gets a little bit of root texture and that's not something you",
    "start": 693
  },
  {
    "content": "have to do but kind of helps hide that blue the glue gun so it doesn't just",
    "start": 698
  },
  {
    "content": "look like a blob let you put on",
    "start": 703
  },
  {
    "content": "you can we'll paint these like kinda like roots",
    "start": 708
  },
  {
    "content": "that one last one okay so we'll give that a minute to dry",
    "start": 716
  },
  {
    "content": "now what I'm going to do is I'm not going to show you I'll show you a",
    "start": 735
  },
  {
    "content": "painting that I'll just tell you what I'm gonna do I'm going to paint the",
    "start": 738
  },
  {
    "content": "roots the dark brown like I did with the rest of the piece and then I'm going to",
    "start": 741
  },
  {
    "content": "use a light tan on the roots to kind of make them pop out so I'll show you that",
    "start": 745
  },
  {
    "content": "in a minute after I complete that so here are painted the roots and I've",
    "start": 750
  },
  {
    "content": "got it all ready for play now you can see there the root detail that I put in",
    "start": 762
  },
  {
    "content": "there with the hot glue around the piece do another one",
    "start": 770
  },
  {
    "content": "see the same got going on there so that kind of hides the hot glue aspect of",
    "start": 773
  },
  {
    "content": "gluing those pieces of grass down there now you could also add some moss to this",
    "start": 778
  },
  {
    "content": "which would be pretty easy just add a little bit of glue and you can get that",
    "start": 788
  },
  {
    "content": "that moss that you can use on models and things at",
    "start": 794
  },
  {
    "content": "the hobby store or you could just paint it on with a brush just kind of stipple",
    "start": 800
  },
  {
    "content": "it on just take your brush and just stipple it like dotted on in a line or",
    "start": 803
  },
  {
    "content": "cluster and you could you even use a different colored green to kind of bring",
    "start": 808
  },
  {
    "content": "it out so I like use a darker green than the lighter green on top of it so there",
    "start": 814

  {
    "content": "we go now I'll show you what it looks like with a with a set up with some",
