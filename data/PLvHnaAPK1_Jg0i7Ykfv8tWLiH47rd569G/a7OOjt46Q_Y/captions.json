    "content": "getting it totally yellow that's not necessary but as I lift it up a little",

  },
  {
    "content": "bit you can see a little bit more detail now I put the yellow on the rubble piles",

    "content": "the next step so really all the fire effect is is",

    "content": "actually better if you don't so just use the same brush and continue on with what",

  {
    "content": "you're doing so now next we're going to add the red to this mix",

  {
    "content": "okay so daddy my bread on the brush same as the others and then I'll just start",
    "start": 470
  },
  {
    "content": "and I kind of do it for the bottom there kind of makes it look like fire",

  {
    "content": "see how that really starts to pop out I see that's really starting to look like",

    "content": "fire okay now you can see that nice fire are",

    "content": "be donut to look like it's been sometime after the fire happens so what we'll do",

  {
    "content": "is we'll put some black on this and it'll really make the place look like",

    "content": "there's just some embers blowing in the ruin of this cottage so I'm going to use",

  {
    "content": "little more precise with what I'm doing so it doesn't fly come in and then for",

  {
    "content": "these rubble piles you can just start brushing on the top there",

    "content": "some yellow to show through so look how that's mostly gone out but they're sort",
