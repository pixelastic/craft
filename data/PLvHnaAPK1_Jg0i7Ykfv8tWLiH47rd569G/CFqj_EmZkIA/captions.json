    "content": "and then I did another application of glue and there they're pretty nice and",

  },
  {
    "content": "stiff so now I'm going to add them to the tree so I'll grab my glue gun and I",

  },
  {
    "content": "kind of get a feel here see that's some really nice roots on there",
    "start": 465
  },
  {
    "content": "and let those dry for a sec and what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab my glue",

  },
  {
    "content": "gun and start doing a little detail so I want to blend it into the tree a little",

  },
  {
    "content": "better so I just got to put some on the roots there pull it up get a nice blend",

  },
  {
    "content": "and just pull that up into the tree could also do a little detail on the",

  },
  {
    "content": "tree if you like get a little more texture kind of thing although this tree",

  },
  {
    "content": "already has some pretty good texture so give a little extra",

  },
  {
    "content": "all righty so I'll let that dry for a second and then I'm going to move on to",

  },
  {
    "content": "the next step now here you might be wondering why I",

  },
  {
    "content": "have a plastic flower sitting here I'm going to use these for the tree branches",

    "content": "so this this plastic flower was only a dollar ninety-nine but what's nice about",

  },
  {
    "content": "it is it has all these little branch type things on it so I'll just pull",

  },
  {
    "content": "those right off and that's kind of that's what we're looking at there and",
    "start": 591
  },
  {
    "content": "then I'll just get several more so I can use them for the tree and I can I can",

  },
  {
    "content": "make more than one tree out of this I can you know depending on how many",

  {
    "content": "branches I put on I can make you know quite a few trees and how sparse I want",

  {
    "content": "the tree so yeah just just just with this flower is just a few bucks and I",

  {
    "content": "got all these branches that I can use for my trees so I'll get rid of the",

  {
    "content": "flower and then I have these now let's get on to putting these on the tree",

    "content": "so we're going to start is there's a nice hole in the top so I'm going to put",

  {
    "content": "some blue on there and shove this branch in that's a start not a very impressive",
    "start": 638

  {
    "content": "tree so far but so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a punch and I",

  {
    "content": "want to have some more more branches come out at other angles so I'm going to",

    "content": "punch into my main trunk here and then I'm going to grab a branch and I'll flip",

  {
    "content": "a little more variation in the tree itself so let's see I'll add another",
    "start": 700

  {
    "content": "alright we got some nice branch action going on there so now we'll do now is",

  },
  {
    "content": "I'll paint it up and they're all based painted black and then we'll start doing",
    "start": 718

  {
    "content": "some detail painting so there we go so here you go you can see we have the",

  {
    "content": "freestanding so that's not going to fall over so that's a really cool feature but",

  {
    "content": "now what I want to do is I'm going to paint it a dark brown so I'm going to",
    "start": 756

  {
    "content": "use it I'm just using a big brush like this and just hit it this can be a bit",

  {
    "content": "messy you can see I'm getting it on my hands if you're concerned about that you",

  {
    "content": "know where some rubber gloves I'm not obviously all right so we got all that",

    "content": "so now I will let that dry and then we'll put some more detail color on it",
