  },
  {
    "content": "and super cheap so I just measured it out on my cutting mat I used a razor",

  {
    "content": "knife and cut a niche width strip and that will be the channel for",
    "start": 382

  {

    "content": "the 3-inch measured from the center of that down away from the circle and I",

    "content": "don't give me the piece I need and once I get that cut I can kind of measure the",

  {
    "content": "length on the tile itself now when I cut these out I tend to use scissors to cut",

    "content": "when the at the beginning if they go back to the main room you can do that",

  {
    "content": "you how I did that it's super easy so here's what I use guys this Vallejo",
