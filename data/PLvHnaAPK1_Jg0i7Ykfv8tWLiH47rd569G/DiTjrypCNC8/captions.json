    "content": "pretty cool now when you're doing this and you put the glue gun inside the ring",

    "content": "the center of my paper grab my little club and then just start dumping it over",

  },
  {
    "content": "it's just you have all you have a lot more work time and it's it's I would",

  },

    "content": "think I think it's more secure actually than the glue gun because the the sand",

  },

    "content": "tends to sit on top of the glue guns glue as opposed to the glue saturating",
    "start": 396
  },

    "content": "because the glue will soak into the sand and particularly the Elmer's glue-all",
    "start": 403
  },
  {
    "content": "because it's not as viscous is some white glues so it'll tend to soak into",

    "content": "use those are some of the reasons I prefer to use this instead of just using",

  },

    "content": "the hot glue gun so alright so we'll let this dry and then we'll come back for",

  {
    "content": "the next step so now my crater is dried so I'm going to take the sand all right",

  {
    "content": "there we go so we have some nice flocking on there so now I'm going to",

  {
    "content": "what I'm going to do with this now is I'm going to paint it white instead of",

  },
  {
    "content": "black normally I would paint it black because you get the shading and",
    "start": 447
  },
  {
    "content": "everything in there but I want to paint it white because I want the thing to",
    "start": 450
  },
  {
    "content": "look like it's glowing so I'll paint it white first and I'll",
    "start": 455
  },
  {
    "content": "show you how we painted it up so moving on to painting I have it all",
    "start": 458
  },
  {
    "content": "base white and you can see there something more the detail it's easier to",
    "start": 477
  },
  {
    "content": "see when it's painted so now the idea of this is I want to have this like a",
    "start": 481
  },
  {
    "content": "glowing meteorite okay so what I'm gonna do is I do want to have some shading",
    "start": 487
  },
  {
    "content": "inside the crater itself so I'm going to wet down my brush all right and I'm",
    "start": 492
  },
  {
    "content": "gonna use a dark brown I'm gonna use it very wet and then I'm gonna kind of go",
    "start": 498
  },
  {
    "content": "around the inside of the crater and this will just give it a little bit of",

  },
  {
    "content": "shading and then right up to the edge there",
    "start": 515
  },
  {
    "content": "and so I'll finish that up and then we'll come back",
    "start": 528
  },
  {
    "content": "so here the interior of the crater is complete completely washed with brown",
    "start": 535
  },

    "content": "and you can see that I didn't go past the rim I also didn't go on the",
    "start": 539
  },
  {
    "content": "meteorite itself now the edge when it's painted white like this is really hard",
    "start": 543
  },
  {
    "content": "to paint brown so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a black and then",
    "start": 548
  },
  {
    "content": "just paint the edge of the meteorite of the crater I mean so that'll make it",
    "start": 554
  },
  {
    "content": "just easier to paint the regular brown paint okay so now we'll finish that and",
    "start": 560
  },
  {
    "content": "move on to the next step so for the necro that color I want to use kind of a",
    "start": 567
  },
  {
    "content": "sickly green I'm going to use a lemon lime green okay and so what I'm gonna do",
    "start": 574
  },
  {
    "content": "is paint the entire globe with the lemon lime and then with the brown with the",
    "start": 581
  },
  {
    "content": "crater itself I'm gonna kind of dry brush over the raised areas with the",
    "start": 588
  },
  {
    "content": "green and that'll give a nice illusion that the the crater itself is glowing",
    "start": 596
  },
  {
    "content": "okay alright so now I'll finish this up move on to the next step so here we go i",
    "start": 609
  },
  {
    "content": "have the green finished has it dried up yet but it looks looks nice it look",
    "start": 623
  },
  {
    "content": "really looks like that crater is glowing so now I've got the darker outside and",
    "start": 627
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm going to use my dark brown door number and I'm gonna paint over the",
    "start": 630
  },
  {
    "content": "outside area so I'll just go around and finish this up and then we'll come back",
    "start": 638
  },
  {
    "content": "for the next step I do want to have a little bit of different color to the",
    "start": 644
  },
  {
    "content": "green I'm going to use this glow green and it's got like a fluorescent green",
    "start": 650
  },
  {
    "content": "yeah it's it's a very thin color so you won't notice it that much but it does",
    "start": 656
  },
  {
    "content": "give a little bit of color variation just a touch and so that'll give it some",
    "start": 662
  },
  {
    "content": "interesting a little bit of interest okay it's not a",
    "start": 666
  },
  {
    "content": "huge difference but okay you can't see it very well but yeah it does give a",
    "start": 671
  },
  {
    "content": "little bit more interest to that so now I'll let that dry and move on to the",
    "start": 677
  },
  {
    "content": "next step so we're all dry and ready to go so my next phase I want to give this",
    "start": 680
  },
  {
    "content": "kind of the meteorite kind of like a a shell that looks like the interior is",
    "start": 689
  },
  {
    "content": "all glowing and everything so I'm going to use a black metallic so it's just a",
    "start": 695
  },
  {
    "content": "black with metallic flecks in it and they'll just start painting that so",
    "start": 701

  {
    "content": "it's really picking up so it's kind of like reverse shading it's picking up the",

  {
    "content": "texture but leaving the under green to show through okay so now we just",

  },
  {
    "content": "finished that up now with the the circle the ring the crater the remaining part",

  },
  {
    "content": "of the crater I'm just going to use an earth brown to highlight the dark brown",
    "start": 729

  {
    "content": "and then I will paint it like I normally do with earth type projects like I'll",

    "content": "paint the stones thick the grey and then I'll do a little bit of highlight of a",
