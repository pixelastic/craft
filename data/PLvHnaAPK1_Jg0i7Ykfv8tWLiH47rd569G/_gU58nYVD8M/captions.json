  {
    "content": "I'm going to do now is I'm going to measure around the edge of this so I",

  {
    "content": "have the right links to all the pieces so I'll measure that I'll just turn it I",

    "content": "small pieces just to make sure it's level so there and get that on now I'll",

  {
    "content": "just continue to glue okay now I got all my pieces on there",

    "content": "the corners I'm going to use this cardstock this is a centimeter wide just",

  {
    "content": "like the strips that I put on the edge of the car it's also for decoration so",
    "start": 250

  {
    "content": "what I'm going to do is I'm going to get my ruler and I'm going to measure an",

  {
    "content": "inch for each corner but I want to also get the half inch mark because that's",

    "content": "I've got the inch piece and I've got a half inch mark on each piece so I'm",

  {
    "content": "going to do is just kind of stick my thumbnail there and bend it on that",
    "start": 293
  },
  {
    "content": "piece so now I've got it in half but what I'm also going to do to add little",

  {
    "content": "interest is I'm going to cut off the end at an angle so now",

    "content": "it's kind of its kind of sharp on the end okay that'll add some interest so",

  },
  {
    "content": "I'll just do that for all these okay now I've got all the corners cut and as you",
    "start": 322

  {
    "content": "can see they're angled so now glue those on just take the glue gun the generous",
    "start": 334

  {
    "content": "tab each corner just pop it on there and hold for a second so now we got that",
    "start": 348
  },
  {
    "content": "corner there now I'll do the other three so there we go got all four on so this",

  {
    "content": "has a double purpose it hides the corner reinforces it and gives it some visual",

  {
    "content": "interest some we paint this up we'll have some raised areas and not just a",

  },
  {
    "content": "box so there we go and we'll move on to the next step",
    "start": 401
  },
  {
    "content": "so right now the problem I have with the car is you can see the corrugation for",
    "start": 411
  },
  {
    "content": "the edges so I'm going to do is I'm going to use a strip I've cut this it's",
    "start": 417
  },
  {
    "content": "just cardstock it's a quarter of an inch wide and what I'm gonna do is measure",
    "start": 422
  },
  {
    "content": "similar to it before but I'm gonna measure from end to end here so we'll",
    "start": 426
  },
  {
    "content": "cover the entire piece so I'll just double those up and cut it again okay so",
    "start": 435
  },
  {
    "content": "now I'll glue those on the top loop be very careful when you're working with",
    "start": 449
  },
  {
    "content": "this fine detail stuff I'm a hot glue you don't to burn yourself",
    "start": 467
  },
  {
    "content": "okay I've got a nice edge cover there and you'd see the corrugation is covered",
    "start": 474
  },
  {
    "content": "up now do the other side okay now I've got both on there so now what I'm going",
    "start": 479
  },
  {
    "content": "to do is measure these two pieces so I will",
    "start": 489
  },
  {
    "content": "I want to measure after I put it on so I would get it exactly right do a little",
    "start": 493
  },
  {
    "content": "dry test pick up a little bit more looks good",
    "start": 510
  },
  {
    "content": "I got that edge and just gotta do the last edge some measure okay it's gonna",
    "start": 534
  },
  {
    "content": "fit alright so I have my basic car and what I thought I'd do is add a little",
    "start": 558
  },
  {
    "content": "more interest to it so I'm gonna take some of this centimeter wide card stock",
    "start": 570
  },
  {
    "content": "and I'm going to glue to the center I'm just gonna guess to me",
    "start": 580
  },
  {
    "content": "now if that draw has dried I'm going to pick it up and bend it on the edge there",
    "start": 602
  },
  {
    "content": "so now I see where it bends blue just a little strip of hot glue there hold it",
    "start": 610
  },
  {
    "content": "that's good now as you can see it's much bigger than that car so I'll just snip",
    "start": 638
  },
  {
    "content": "it off and there we go so I got a little bit of banding on the edge there it'll",
    "start": 644
  },
  {
    "content": "add some interest and I'm gonna do that all the way around okay there we go I",
    "start": 652
  },
  {
    "content": "have the base of my car but this car is going to be like a hanging car it's not",
    "start": 663
  },
  {
    "content": "going to be on a track so what I need is I wanted to put a bar in the center that",
    "start": 670
  },
  {
    "content": "comes up that simulates says a hanging car so we'll move on to that next",
    "start": 676
  },
  {
    "content": "so here I have my piece of cardboard I'm going to use to make the bar I'm going",
    "start": 686
  },
  {
    "content": "to make it three and a half inches tall this will be my bottom here so I'll just",
    "start": 693
  },
  {
    "content": "measure up three and a half so I'll just have a height there okay so now when I",
    "start": 697
  },
  {
    "content": "make this it's going to be a half an inch wide so I want to be careful that I",
    "start": 706
  },
  {
    "content": "have the corrugation going against it and not with it because if the",
    "start": 709
  },
  {
    "content": "corrugations going with it it'll be weaker so if you look at the side of my",
    "start": 713
  },
  {
    "content": "cardboard you look at this side sorry to be coming up in this bottom part here's",
    "start": 718
  },
  {
    "content": "the court the corrugation is going this way okay so that will make it much",
    "start": 725
  },
  {
    "content": "stronger than if it's going this way so I want to make sure that's correct so",
    "start": 728
  },
  {
    "content": "I'll turn it back and I'm just going to measure a half inch at the bottom here",
    "start": 733
  },
  {
    "content": "and what I'll do is I'll just use my angle",
    "start": 742
  },
  {
    "content": "so now what I want to do is I want to have some angled pieces on the bottom so",
    "start": 760
  },
  {
    "content": "what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna make blocks just to help with that so I",
    "start": 768
  },
  {
    "content": "measure a half an inch out and a half an inch up so that look at me my marks so",
    "start": 772
  },
  {
    "content": "I'll just draw from that point to the bottom so now I've got you can see I've",
    "start": 786
  },
  {
    "content": "got an angle there okay so I actually measured the wrong",
    "start": 798
  },
  {
    "content": "way for this mark so what I'm gonna do is I'll just measure three and a half",
    "start": 801
  },
  {
    "content": "tall so there it is so this is the top and this is the bottom part and what",
    "start": 805
  },
  {
    "content": "I'll do is I'll cut this out with the sharp knife and I'll show you what that",
    "start": 820
  },
  {
    "content": "looks like you",
