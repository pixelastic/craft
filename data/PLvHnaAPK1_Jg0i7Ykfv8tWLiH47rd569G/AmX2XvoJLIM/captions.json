  {
    "content": "did kind of u-shaped fire with the glue gun and I did it a couple times I did it",
    "start": 79

  {
    "content": "like twice on each side so I would do the do it on one side turn it over do it",

    "content": "on the other side then do it again on the previous side and then do it on the",

    "content": "pay special attention to the tops where you put the the points of the fire",

    "content": "what I did was I painted them both sides black and then I repainted the one side",

    "content": "with a with a white flat spray paint now what I'm going to do is I'm going to",

  {
    "content": "secure them easier so that it's easier to work on them okay",

  {
    "content": "so I've done is I'm lined up in rows and the sheet underneath is a thin cardstock",

  {
    "content": "so I put a dab of hot glue in the center so not only does that fill the center it",

  {
    "content": "I did the fire technique I first painted them yellow then I did some orange and I",

    "content": "did a little bit of red now you can see how I painted these I pulled the brush",

  {
    "content": "now in this picture I've taken one of the disks I cut the disk out to make",
    "start": 227
  },
  {
    "content": "them easier to manipulate so I just cut them out of the sheet but I left them",
    "start": 232
  },
  {
    "content": "attached to the sheet so then I use the glue gun the mini glue gun to pull glue",
    "start": 236

  {
    "content": "into the center to give some texture to this",
    "start": 243

    "content": "bottom of the flame stuck it to the base and then I ended up with some hot glue",
    "start": 257

  {
    "content": "quite a bit of hot glue on each side of the flame so I just took the nozzle of",

  {
    "content": "the mini hot glue gun and pulled it up into the flame this can be where it",

    "content": "really helps to have the smaller glue gun so you can get into those areas but",

    "content": "bit about it okay you can see the light coming through it and that really adds a",

    "content": "cool effect to that stand okay so you can see on the base I paint a little bit",

    "content": "see I just used the same fire technique that I used on the other the other fire",

    "content": "that I did I just washed it yellow then put a little bit of red on it on the",

    "content": "that that Center is where the fire is the kind of cool thing about these two",

    "content": "is like the center since the fires in the center you could actually set a guy",
    "start": 413

  {
    "content": "while they're on fire so it's that's have a cool effect since it's mostly",

  {
    "content": "like halfway between the base so yeah that's that's a really neat idea you can",

    "content": "put that you could put a figure on there and move around with a figure like",
