  {
    "content": "edges so you can see those edges really pop out so now we're going to do shading",
    "start": 403

    "content": "so basically it's a it's a it's the wet technique so we're going to get some",

  },
  {
    "content": "water on a brush get the paint pretty thin and then run around the edges",
    "start": 413

  {
    "content": "so pops out now you see that start to pop out I'm going to color that Center",
    "start": 426

  {
    "content": "in there pretty dark so I'm going to continue to pick out the edges and I've",
    "start": 436
  },
  {
    "content": "got a color the chant one two and then we'll move on to the next so now I've",

  },
  {
    "content": "got the edges picked out you can see how those walls really pop out now so what",
    "start": 450
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm going to do is I had colored the center square here but I'm going to",
    "start": 454
  },
  {
    "content": "color the rest of the channel I'm going to keep it very wet so kind of the same",
    "start": 458
  },
  {
    "content": "thing so here I'll start to color this channel",
    "start": 462
  },
  {
    "content": "in you can see it's still pretty wet just fill right in and I'll do the rest",
    "start": 464

  {
    "content": "and we'll come back for the next step so it's very wet",

    "content": "okay as you can see I've colored the base black in there but now I'm going to",
    "start": 484

  {
    "content": "add some Brown because this is supposed to be a like where all the extra man and",

  },
  {
    "content": "waste from the cells goes so I'll give that a dark brown",
    "start": 495

    "content": "I'll fill that in don't fill in that middle hole but just the channels now",
    "start": 501

  {
    "content": "while it's still wet I'm going to use a lighter brown and just add that so it",
    "start": 510
  },
  {
    "content": "gives it a variation of tone and I've got two even light brown which I a",
    "start": 526
  },
  {
    "content": "little bit of so that really starts to pop out and so",
    "start": 533
  },
  {
    "content": "we'll finish that up and then we'll move on okay you can see we got the whole",
    "start": 555
  },
  {
    "content": "tile going here we've got the channels painted with the nastiness a little bit",
    "start": 559

    "content": "of brown on each on each of these cells this isn't a cell so these walls here",

  {
    "content": "interesting the channels have the excrement and waste and sewage and stuff",
    "start": 608
  },

    "content": "in them so when the paint dries it will look flat it won't look very wet so what",

  {
    "content": "we can do is use some water-based gloss and this is just what I like about the",

    "content": "water base is it's easy water cleanup you don't have to worry about all the",

  {
    "content": "chemicals and mineral spirits and stuff so we'll just pop that open and we'll",
    "start": 639
  },
  {
    "content": "paint in the channels so I'll get a plate to put that on and pop that open",
    "start": 644
  },
  {
    "content": "so now I'll just dab it on and be careful you want to just get it in the",
    "start": 662
  },
  {
    "content": "channel you don't want to get anywhere else and this will be nice in making the",
    "start": 669
  },
  {
    "content": "channel look wet so it'll have that extra just bit of realism you can do",
    "start": 676
  },
  {
    "content": "this with any kind of technique or with any tile that you have some kind of",
    "start": 687
  },
  {
    "content": "liquid on and it works really well and like I say the water-based is nice",
    "start": 691
  },
  {
    "content": "because you don't have to worry about the harsh chemicals to clean up",
    "start": 698
  },
  {
    "content": "afterwards you just use soap and water to clean this brush off and you'll be",
    "start": 701
  },
  {
    "content": "good to go for the next time and this jar will last you forever because you",

  {
    "content": "know you're not going to be you're not painting that much so you'll have this",

  {
    "content": "forever so one jar is really all you need so we just about got it done here",
    "start": 718

  {
    "content": "talked about and that's kind of like we have the cells here I'll move this we",
