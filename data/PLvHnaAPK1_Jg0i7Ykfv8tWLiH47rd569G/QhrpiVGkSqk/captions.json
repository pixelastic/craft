    "content": "show you what I did so I have I couldn't make them all on one sheet so I took",

    "content": "alright and so you can see a little bit they",

  },
  {
    "content": "connect like that okay so I had to actually had to use three pieces but I",

  },
  {
    "content": "think it gives a nice ice effect nice quick cheap ice effect so essentially",
    "start": 127
  },
  {
    "content": "what I did is I just took the plastic sheet and I took white spray paint and I",
    "start": 132
  },
  {
    "content": "used a piece of card and I would kind of line it up like this and then then kind",

  },
  {
    "content": "of give it a quick spray hit okay and so that would that kind of gave that nice",

  {
    "content": "bit of a line there but it's not bad I mean it doesn't look horrible or",

  {
    "content": "anything and then I had this was a way to go up so this little cul-de-sac here",

  {
    "content": "went up to another level I was about 20 feet up okay and so I had cut that piece",

  {
    "content": "really nice for just how easy and simple and quick it was to do this okay so if",

  },
  {
    "content": "you see my other video you know that the magic user I figured that magic user",
    "start": 216

    "content": "would dispel the ice because I made it seem as dangerous as possible and highly",

    "content": "into the next room and they had to they had to make multiple checks try not to",

  {
    "content": "get to get shredded on those rocks but so that's what I like about this",
    "start": 235
  },
  {
    "content": "technique you can just pull this right off and then there's no more ice okay",

  {
    "content": "now I could have made these permanently I see if I wanted to but I decided it",

    "content": "make it so that you can use reuse caverns and put ice in them this is a",

    "content": "great technique to do that so so now I want to show you the other room that the",

  },
  {
    "content": "players would have to tangle with okay so here's the room I was talking",
    "start": 271

  {
    "content": "up when I set up the tile so I just said that these were up okay so the trick to",

  },
  {
    "content": "them shut okay if they try to dispel this okay the doors slammed down so they",

  },
  {
    "content": "out of that then all the sand pours out okay so which could bury them in sand",

  {
    "content": "which is kind of nasty but also if the water comes down and they dispel the air",
    "start": 349
  },
  {
    "content": "elemental because it's like a vortex in here a watery it's like a watery vortex",
    "start": 355

  {
    "content": "they're spinning around in the water but the sand will come in so they may end up",

  {
    "content": "getting stuck in the sand so that's pretty nasty they didn't they they",

    "content": "when they got forced down into this pit from the water deluge they managed to do",
    "start": 379
  },
  {
    "content": "enough checks to get out of here couple of them are one of them did good the",
    "start": 386
  },
  {
    "content": "mage did go down but they managed to pull him out and everything so it was",
    "start": 390
  },
  {
    "content": "pretty hairy but they did get out of it yeah it was pretty it was pretty rough",
    "start": 394
  },
  {
    "content": "so there you go there's the the pit part of this where the pit ends up there's",

  },
  {
    "content": "also another tunnel that I had a whole treasure thing I guess",
    "start": 405
  },
  {
    "content": "show that to and they had it wasn't part of this trap but it was another whole",
    "start": 409
  },
  {
    "content": "thing and there was an exit like about 24 15 feet up or 20 feet up actually",
    "start": 413
  },
  {
    "content": "from this from this so it came out here and then dropped okay",
    "start": 420
  },
  {
    "content": "so that was a whole nother section of the dungeon if the players got separated",
    "start": 424

  {
    "content": "to create the ice walls I did a very similar technique to what I did for the",

    "content": "iSpring I put a little bit of PVA glue on it and then sprinkled some of the",
