  {
    "content": "pricey you have to do you have to buy some supplies for my method but they're",

  {
    "content": "a lot cheaper than if you tried to buy crystals for your games online and the",

  },
  {
    "content": "great thing about this my method is you can make them really any shape and size",

    "content": "and you can change the color and so what I'm going to do in this video is show",

    "content": "make the best bases so I got some of these and I just need one for right now",

    "content": "think I like about them though is there's different sizes so there's",

  },
  {
    "content": "there's bigger crystals and then smoth some smaller ones too so that'll be",

    "content": "really nice for making different types of crystal formations so let's grab some",

  },
  {
    "content": "of those out of the bag and I've got plenty I can use these forever the thing",

  {
    "content": "gonna need to apply them so I'm just gonna use my handy glue gun here and",

  },
  {
    "content": "what I'll do is I'm gonna put a big crystal on first I think I'll just put",

  },
  {
    "content": "it like there and I'll just get that ready",

  },
  {
    "content": "okay so now I'm gonna build up some smaller crystals on this base just put a",

  },
  {
    "content": "DAB there so then you can you can easily build up different crystal formations",
    "start": 123
  },

    "content": "and I could even use a bigger one on here which I think I'll do",

  {
    "content": "this is a very inexpensive alternative to some of those expensive crystals you",

  },
  {
    "content": "can buy for your game table alright so we'll let that harden up a minute and",

  },
  {
    "content": "then we'll move on to the next step hey guys here's my crystal vase and you",
    "start": 173
  },
  {
    "content": "can see I glued some sand on that on the edges so I just did the flocking",

  },
  {
    "content": "technique with the white glue and then put the irregular sand on there now I'm",

  },
  {
    "content": "not gonna paint this black because I don't want to cover the crystals up I",
    "start": 199
  },
  {
    "content": "like the transparent quality so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a",
    "start": 201
  },
  {
    "content": "metallic plum and I'm gonna give these crystals some color but I'm gonna wet my",
    "start": 205
  },
  {
    "content": "brush quite a bit and I don't I'm not trying to cover these crystals up I'm",

  },
  {
    "content": "just trying to give them a little bit of color so I'll get it wet and then I'll",
    "start": 217
  },
  {
    "content": "just start painting on that so this will help give these crystals some color and",
    "start": 221
  },
  {
    "content": "that way you can deal with any metallic color and then you won't be stuck with a",
    "start": 229
  },
  {
    "content": "particular color you can make them any color you want so that's what's really",
    "start": 235
  },
  {
    "content": "cool about this technique so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to lead off",
    "start": 238
  },
  {
    "content": "a little bit of that paint with a brush so I just basically wipe the brush off",
    "start": 242
  },
  {
    "content": "on my paper here and I'll just pick up a little bit of the color so if there's",
    "start": 246
  },
  {
    "content": "seems like it's pooling too much in certain places just pick it just pick it",
    "start": 251
  },
  {
    "content": "up and it'll it'll keep it from doing that alright alright cool so now we got",
    "start": 255
  },
  {
    "content": "a nice color on those crystals and what we'll do is we'll let this dry and then",
    "start": 263
  },
  {
    "content": "we'll finish up with the base hey guys here's a tie with my crystals",
    "start": 267
  },
  {
    "content": "on I think they came out really great these were pretty cheap to make and you",
    "start": 284
  },
  {
    "content": "know they look really nice so what is I you know I just painted the the rubble",
    "start": 290
  },
  {
    "content": "on the side of the crystals I painted it black and then did a pewter gray on it",
    "start": 296
  },
  {
    "content": "and then paint and highlighted it with dolphin gray so it just really blends",
    "start": 302
  },
  {
    "content": "into the tile itself now the crystals that coloration is just really nice it",
    "start": 305
  },
  {
    "content": "just gives it enough color to be interesting but not too much that you",
    "start": 310
  },
  {
    "content": "can't see the you can't see the transparency of the crystals so I think",
    "start": 314
  },
  {
    "content": "that's really really nice or the translucency I think that's really nice",
    "start": 318
  },
  {
    "content": "now in game I had it so that a mage could come up to the crystal and drain",

  {
    "content": "the crystal and gain a daily power back but they would lose a healing surge for",
    "start": 327
  },
  {
    "content": "doing that also I had these crystals were very volatile on the battlefield",
    "start": 331
  },
  {
    "content": "and if they took a hit they would explode and they did quite a bit of",

  {
    "content": "damage so if you watch my newest play beds you'll see they caused quite a bit",

    "content": "of mayhem on the battlefield for the players from the players and for the",

  },
  {
    "content": "players so all right there you go there's some nice crystals and I'll see",
    "start": 350

  {
    "content": "you next time on the craft hey you yeah you back here huh I know it was short",

  {
    "content": "quit bugging me hey and make sure you join the forum too much for that oh yeah",
