    "content": "and then I will see if it dad doesn't happen I'll go through this method so",

  },
  {
    "content": "let me see what happens here so just apply some pressure with the base down",

  },
  {
    "content": "place the pressure the figure all right I just popped it right off the",

  },
  {
    "content": "bass now you may get a little bit of that bass residue on there so what I'm",

  },
  {
    "content": "going to do is just take an exacto and just scrape that off you want to get it",

  },
  {
    "content": "as flat as possible so it'll adhere to the new bass",

    "content": "so now I call that excess black base off there and now I will get ready to apply",

    "content": "it to the base itself so here I've got a figure and I've got a",

    "content": "stick a little better to the to the base itself is I'm going to score the bottom",

    "content": "little scores in the figure itself these are like a hard plastic so they're they",

  {
    "content": "score pretty well and this will just help give it some adhesion to the base",

  },
  {
    "content": "I've got that scored I'm a score the bass little bit too so it's not too bad",
    "start": 388
  },
  {
    "content": "okay now generally what I was doing was I was",
    "start": 405
  },
  {
    "content": "using epoxy to glue these on but I found a substitute that I really",
    "start": 410
  },
  {
    "content": "liked it's called goop and it's nice because",
    "start": 419
  },
  {
    "content": "you don't have to mix it you're not like unlike epoxy you don't have to mix it",

  {
    "content": "together so it's less messy it is very viscous though so be careful about using",
    "start": 432
  },
  {
    "content": "it you don't want to squirt too much out just a little dab will do or basically",
    "start": 438
  },
  {
    "content": "so I'm going to apply that to the base or to the figure and then stick it to",

  {
    "content": "the base there we go I got my dad on there now",
    "start": 448

  {
    "content": "I'll just put it to the center of the base",

  {
    "content": "and there we go I've got my finger all stuck to the base I think I like about",

  {
    "content": "the goop - is it it has a lot of strength as far as the initial hold",
    "start": 476
  },
  {
    "content": "epoxy is very weak in the initial hold so stuff keeps falling over or falling",
    "start": 481
  },
  {
    "content": "off so I found that the goop actually this figure is no problem cuz it has a",
    "start": 487
  },
  {
    "content": "large base but other figures that have smaller bases or you know feet stand up",
    "start": 491
  },
  {
    "content": "much better with the goop than they do with the epoxy so we'll let that dry and",
    "start": 497
  },
  {
    "content": "then we'll come back and finish up our figure here",
    "start": 502
  },
  {
    "content": "you so my goop is dried on the face and now",

  {
    "content": "I'm going to use mine on my modelling friends",

    "content": "it's the flexible modeling paste to do some texture in the base so open that",

  {
    "content": "brush I'm using is fairly thin it's fairly stiff so let me get some modeling",

  {
    "content": "paste up and then I was kind of grouping on the",

  },
  {
    "content": "this is very similar to what I did with the the croc",
    "start": 562
  },
  {
    "content": "but what I want to do is I want to kind of make the the base look like it's",

  },
  {
    "content": "swirling up into the figure so okay so I've got that on there so",
    "start": 583

    "content": "now what I'll do is I'll start pulling somewhat of the figure",

  {
    "content": "trying to get a balance between seeing what I'm doing and showing you what I'm",

    "content": "swirling out of the base going up another finger",

  {
    "content": "repurposed the old eel acid use miniature and I really like how it looks",

    "content": "like it's popping out of the base like it's coming out of the mud and that's",
