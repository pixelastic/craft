    "content": "I'll do that for the top so now I'm going to kind of straighten that out a",

  },

    "content": "bit and then the creases will stay still stay in it",
    "start": 188
  },
  {
    "content": "so these will be nice easel like simulate cracks in the pillar so that's",

    "content": "grab our trusty glue gun here okay so that's glued and you can see",

    "content": "can just have the top of the pillar off or you could have it in more there are",

    "content": "top I've bent this in a little bit so it'll fill in that little gap so I'll go",

    "content": "down a little bit so it looks like it's kind of smashed off I just cut a little",

  {
    "content": "these other pillar pieces that have nothing in them so what I'm going to do",

    "content": "is I'm gonna use some brown paper okay now you could use any really any kind of",

  },
  {
    "content": "paper break a piece off and this kind of crinkle it up nice and crinkly and the",
    "start": 367

  },
  {
    "content": "I'll I'll put it in there okay but first I need to put some glue in there",
    "start": 388
  },
  {
    "content": "so let's mash that in there and they'll kind of help give it up broken look in",

  {
    "content": "the color and just play with it to your satisfied",

  },
  {
    "content": "it's lower than the edge of the of the pillar okay so there we go get some",
    "start": 439
  },
  {
    "content": "paper stuffed in there so now what you want to do is we're going to use some",
    "start": 447
  },
  {
    "content": "glue so I'll get the hot glue gun and then I'm just going to start adding glue",

  },
  {
    "content": "and covering up the paper we're being very generous with the glue here",
    "start": 460
  },
  {
    "content": "but still trying to keep some texture so you know wheel your nozzle your glue gun",
    "start": 472
  },
  {
    "content": "around keep that texture okay there we go we've got that filled up pretty",
    "start": 491
  },
  {
    "content": "nicely alright so what I'm gonna do is let that dry for a minute and then I",
    "start": 504
  },
  {
    "content": "might hit it again I'll see how it how it looks and then we'll fill all the",
    "start": 513
  },
  {
    "content": "rest of them so we'll fill this side then we'll fill this one in this one and",
    "start": 518
  },
  {
    "content": "then the final this is the top so we'll fill will fill that part okay so we'll",
    "start": 523
  },
  {
    "content": "do that I'll do that next in and we'll come back and show you what we got",
    "start": 529
  },
  {
    "content": "all right here we go I have my three pieces I have a top piece the bottom",
    "start": 539
  },
  {
    "content": "piece and the middle piece so let me show you that little detail in there and",
    "start": 544
  },
  {
    "content": "what I did once I got the piece of paper stuck in there I just went over a little",
    "start": 548
  },
  {
    "content": "bit with the glue gun to add some texture because you have to have quite a",
    "start": 555
  },
  {
    "content": "bit of glue to get it kind of solidified in there so I just added a little bit",
    "start": 558
  },
  {
    "content": "like less glue and just move the tip around and kind of made a little more",
    "start": 562
  },
  {
    "content": "texture it's hard to see because it's pretty clear but that's what I did when",
    "start": 566
  },
  {
    "content": "we paint it that'll be a parent so now I got a couple options here's the base",
    "start": 571
  },
  {
    "content": "what I could do what I'm when I'm thinking I'll do is I'll have the base",
    "start": 577
  },
  {
    "content": "standing up and then the middle part like this and then the end part like",
    "start": 580
  },
  {
    "content": "this so what I'll do is I'll attach all these to a base and I'll add some some",
    "start": 587
  },
  {
    "content": "flocking to help enhance this with some Wisam like looks like smaller pieces",
    "start": 592
  },
  {
    "content": "that are broken off I could actually have the last piece that's fallen down",
    "start": 598
  },
  {
    "content": "also keep in mind when you the let this last piece is going to be have all the",
    "start": 602
  },
  {
    "content": "detail from the other pillars you know how we had the layering detail on here",
    "start": 609
  },
  {
    "content": "but you can see the pillar is broken so it's unlikely that the detailing will go",
    "start": 614
  },
  {
    "content": "all the way up so we'll just have partial kind of detailing on that and",
    "start": 619
  },
  {
    "content": "I'll show you how to do that now so I've got my pillar base and I've got",
    "start": 623
  },
  {
    "content": "five or four or the four different sides these are the shorter pieces and the",
    "start": 635
  },
  {
    "content": "longer pieces so now as you can see when I put this up here it's taller than the",
    "start": 639
  },
  {
    "content": "base of the pillar itself so what I'll do is I'll just lay that down put it on",
    "start": 648
  },
  {
    "content": "top and then trace so I'll just kind of cut that off and Jack a little edgy okay",
    "start": 653
  },
  {
    "content": "so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to glue that on so I'll get my glue gun",
    "start": 669
  },
  {
    "content": "and pop that side right on there now the shorter piece isn't going to come to the",
    "start": 680
  },
  {
    "content": "top so what I can do is I can just put that on there as as a regular piece what",
    "start": 690
  },
  {
    "content": "you can also do is you could bend these a little bit like I did the pillar and",
    "start": 699
  },
  {
    "content": "it'll make kind of creases into the into it and since it's mostly covering that",
    "start": 706
  },
  {
    "content": "up all right so we get that side then so",
    "start": 714
  },
  {
    "content": "now since I'm gonna have this standing up I'm gonna do all four sides but if",
    "start": 725
  },
  {
    "content": "you want to have it laying down you wouldn't have to do the third side you",
    "start": 730
  },
  {
    "content": "could just you could just put them on the sides that you'll see no point and",
    "start": 732
  },
  {
    "content": "put it on there if it's laying on so what I'll do is I'll put the rest of",
    "start": 735
  },
  {
    "content": "those on there and I also have these little triangles and then I had added on",
    "start": 738
  },
  {
    "content": "the other on the other piece so I'll attach those to the bottom there and",
    "start": 744
  },
  {
    "content": "I'll go ahead and put all the rest of these on and then we'll show you what I",
    "start": 751
  },
  {
    "content": "got okay now here I have a piece of",
    "start": 755
  },
  {
    "content": "cardstock for the base you can see I added all the details on the bottom of",
    "start": 764
  },
  {
    "content": "the pillar I also put it on the pedestal so I also added the little triangles to",
    "start": 769
  },
  {
    "content": "the top of the pillar so now we're going to do now is I'm going to do a placement",
    "start": 776
  },
  {
    "content": "on the cardstock just see where things will lay out so I'll put the base what",
    "start": 781
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm going to do is I think I'm going to have it laying like this yeah so like",
    "start": 788
  },
  {
    "content": "that and then I'll lay the last one like this so now I've got the kind of layout",
    "start": 797
  },
  {
    "content": "so that'll give me an idea how big the base will be so I'm going to take a",
    "start": 803
  },
  {
    "content": "sharpie and trace around and give myself plenty of room because I want to add",
    "start": 806
  },
  {
    "content": "some rubble here too alright so now I've got the base run out of the cardstock",
    "start": 811
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm not gonna glue this down just yet because what I want to do is I want to",
    "start": 823
  },
  {
    "content": "paint the pillar and then put it on and then I'm going to paint the base with",
    "start": 828
  },
  {
    "content": "the I'll cut this out first so I don't lose the shape and then I'll paint the",
    "start": 835
  },
  {
    "content": "base with the texture paint so to match the dungeon so this will be like a great",
    "start": 840
  },
  {
    "content": "texture paint and then I'll paint this like the other pillars so go ahead and",
    "start": 846
  },
  {
    "content": "do that now come back in then we'll start painting",
    "start": 851
  },
  {
    "content": "up the pillar all right so I've got my pieces here",
    "start": 855
  },
  {
    "content": "ready to assemble I've got my base now this is just a piece of cardstock and",
    "start": 865
  },
  {
    "content": "what I did is I painted the texture paint on this card stock and then I",
    "start": 869
  },
  {
    "content": "sprayed a little bit with a little bit of dark because the pillars gonna be",
    "start": 874

    "content": "laying there so that's what that's and that's about and some of you might be",
    "start": 877

  {
    "content": "wondering why did I do this well I didn't want to paint the pillar with the",
    "start": 883
  },
  {
    "content": "texture paint so to keep the two separate I did the pillar pieces",
    "start": 887
  },
  {
    "content": "separately and then I painted the base if I pre glued them together then I have",
    "start": 891
  },
  {
    "content": "to paint the whole thing with texture paint so what I did is I painted the",
    "start": 896
  },
  {
    "content": "pillar pieces and as you can see I paint them just like the other pillars I just",
    "start": 900
  },
  {
    "content": "added some cracks along the the folds that we created in the cardboard and you",

    "content": "can see there's the top the inside there that wadded paper we put in and we use",
    "start": 911

  {
    "content": "the glue gun on so that fills that top in and so here's the other pieces here's",

  {
    "content": "one on the other side that's the middle and then the very top of the pillar",
    "start": 921

  {
    "content": "there we go okay so I've got all those pieces done",
    "start": 926
  },
  {
    "content": "so now what I want to do is I'm going to glue it to this base so I'm going to",

  },
  {
    "content": "glue the big part here so I will grab my glue gun",
    "start": 937
  },

    "content": "okay just head down for a few seconds all right so now I've got that attached",

  {
    "content": "to my base so now I have to decide how I want this to go I could do like this I",
    "start": 958
  },
  {
    "content": "think what I wanted to do was have it go up a little bit so I'll go like this and",
    "start": 967
  },
  {
    "content": "make it that way so let me take a gander here okay kind of find the points I need",

  {
    "content": "to glue so I will grab that and I'll put the glue on these different points",

  {
    "content": "that's why it's always good to kind of pre",

    "content": "pillar laying there so now I'll put the top on and I'll put it right there so to",
