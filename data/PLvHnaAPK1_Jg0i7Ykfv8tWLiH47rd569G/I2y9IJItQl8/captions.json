    "content": "the basic cardboard I cut them out and put them together but I haven't paid",

  {
    "content": "you know easy to do but there are a couple of considerations when doing this",

    "content": "the next tile it'll be like this so the stairs come up you I hope you can see",
    "start": 119
  },
  {
    "content": "that there's different because they're just cardstock there so I've kind of I'm",

  {
    "content": "gonna paint that to simulate the stairs like I did in the initial stair video I",

    "content": "stairs going up like this so it's like the reverse of the other the other",
