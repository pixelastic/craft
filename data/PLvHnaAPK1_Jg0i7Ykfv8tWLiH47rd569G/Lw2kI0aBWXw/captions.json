    "content": "I'm gonna glue the 1 inch strip there to it and I'm using white glue to give me a",

    "content": "time don't use my exacto knife and cut the edge off there just like that and",

    "content": "I'll glue the second strip now I want I'm doing this because I want channels",

    "content": "effect which is you simulate the walls by using short walls right so they don't",

    "content": "came out with years ago and we'll glue that on yeah we got the",

  {
    "content": "may have noticed that these are very kind of white Lockean in nature right",

    "content": "this with his tiles they're a little more modular than what I'm doing here",

  },
  {

  {
    "content": "see what we add to add some interest to this alright so here's my tile and the",
    "start": 433
  },
  {
    "content": "broken area you can see and I've got this construction sand which is",
    "start": 438

  {
    "content": "essentially sand with different sized aggregate and okay and it's it's all",

  },
  {
    "content": "called all-purpose sand so I'm just gonna put my white glue in that channel",

  {
    "content": "there fill that in so it'll look like the",

  },
  {
    "content": "channels are broken right that'll be really cool so we'll just pour that in",
    "start": 454

  {
    "content": "let that dry for a little bit we dumped out the excess I'm actually going to add",

  {
    "content": "another layer and that'll take it pretty much up to the top of the channel and",
    "start": 461
  },
  {
    "content": "it'll really look like that's just a kind of a broken area of the channel so",
    "start": 466
  },
  {
    "content": "really cool really cool we have our tile constructed so now comes the time to",
    "start": 469
  },
  {
    "content": "paint it so now I need to cover up this these white areas that are on the foam",
    "start": 474
  },
  {
    "content": "core right so I'm using black acrylic paint mixed with white glue okay and so",
    "start": 478

  {
    "content": "that will kind of harden this up a bit so it's a nice technique to do it kind",
    "start": 486
  },
  {
    "content": "of seal the foam and harden it up a bit so that's why I'm doing that just mix it",
    "start": 492
  },
  {
    "content": "with the white glue and just fill in those edges",
    "start": 496
  },
  {

  {
    "content": "mostly you know covered in black paper anyway so you don't have to paint the",
    "start": 510

  {
    "content": "whole thing so that's really nice and just finish that up and it'll be good",

  {
    "content": "the painting phase and we're doing a very similar thing here you I'm using my",

  {
    "content": "white glue and then my pewter gray acrylic craft paint and a damp sponge",
    "start": 534

  {
    "content": "kind of effect I've see I'm getting a nice kind of cement look there this is",

  {
    "content": "gonna be I'm kind of simulating a sewer and it's gonna be like cement so yeah",
