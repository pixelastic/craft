  },

    "content": "then we'll come back so now I put enough in them to give them strength okay so",

    "content": "could even cut some of this cut some of this off on the bottom if you wanted to",

    "content": "be closer to the ground so but I'm I think I'm liking that they kind of bend",

    "content": "it down like that so what I'm going to do is I will use my glue gun and I'm",

  {
    "content": "gonna start gluing this together so I got my big glue gun this will make it a",

  {
    "content": "assembling this so I'll just get some punch of hot glue on there just pop it",

  },

  },
  {
    "content": "hey guys I've got my armature done and you can see it just kind of looks kind",

  },
  {
    "content": "of crazy right now all that bent up toilet paper I did I did cut it with",
    "start": 532
  },
  {
    "content": "some hot glue to kind of keep it in shape while I put the wet toilet paper",

  {
    "content": "I've got some gaps in there I think what I'm going to do is take some of my",

  {
    "content": "just going to put it right in there and then just put some white glue on it so",
    "start": 557
  },
  {
    "content": "let me finish the finish this up I'll do this fill up with a little bit of these",

  {
    "content": "gaps then we'll move on to the next step all right so I've filled in some of",

  {
    "content": "those gaps with the whip Simon fell off okay I filled in some of those gaps with",
    "start": 572
  },
  {
    "content": "some toilet paper and I'm just going to go ahead and go right to the next step",
    "start": 577
  },
  {
    "content": "and start applying the skin to this so yeah just let's kind of hit Galati",
    "start": 581
  },
  {
    "content": "mess right now but it'll be really cool when we finish all right so he's going",

  },
  {
    "content": "to grab a piece of piece of paper towel get that wet I'm just wetting it in",
    "start": 591
  },
  {
    "content": "water I'm actually going to apply the glue",
    "start": 596
  },
  {
    "content": "later so for those of you don't know my blue technique I just generally use",
    "start": 599
  },
  {
    "content": "white glue water paper towels or toilet paper and I soaked it and then I put put",
    "start": 603
  },
  {
    "content": "some blue on it okay so you can get this in frame so just going to wrap that",
    "start": 611
  },
  {
    "content": "around and this is just a wet paper towel that's all this is",
    "start": 617
  },
  {
    "content": "so now I'll just start hitting it with the glue like this and then spreading it",
    "start": 629
  },
  {
    "content": "out so now I'll finish this up I'll finish applying some up here to the top",
    "start": 640
  },
  {
    "content": "also and we'll let this dry and then we'll move on to the next step",
    "start": 649
  },
  {
    "content": "this is good to do while the body of the worm itself is drying and hardening up",
    "start": 667
  },
  {
    "content": "and also I want to mention that while your make sure you put another coat of",
    "start": 672
  },
  {
    "content": "the white glue on it after it dries a bit so it'll it'll give it some strength",
    "start": 676
  },
  {
    "content": "but the worms themselves tend to have like some kind of hard shell on the",
    "start": 682
  },
  {
    "content": "outside the newer versions of the worm so I'm going to do that make that by",
    "start": 689
  },
  {
    "content": "using cardstock and I've already started here basically these are four inches",
    "start": 694
  },
  {
    "content": "wide I've marked one inch increments on the",

  },
  {
    "content": "four inch wide strip and you can see I've drawn a little bit on here so what",

  },
  {
    "content": "I'm going to do is I don't want to do just a straight strip I want to try to",
    "start": 707
  },
  {
    "content": "mimic the carapace so I'm going to do just draw like this",
    "start": 709
  },
  {
    "content": "and you'll see what I'm doing this so I mean I'll mimic it not the same thing on",
    "start": 719
  },
  {
    "content": "the other side and it's not does not be perfect see I'm not worried about being",
    "start": 723
  },
  {
    "content": "a being totally perfect here okay so now what I'll do is I will finish the rest",
    "start": 730
  },
  {
    "content": "of these and then we'll cut them out here I have my cardboard with the",
    "start": 737
  },
  {
    "content": "scalloped edge and you can see I have this lines on there so I'm going to do",
    "start": 744
  },
  {
    "content": "is bend it on that line and then I'm going to use a pair of pliers and go",
    "start": 748
  },
  {
    "content": "about a quarter of an inch in and then grab and Bend so what I end up with is a",
    "start": 760
  },
  {
    "content": "dimple okay on the outside all right so now when I finish I'm going",
    "start": 769
  },
  {
    "content": "to it's going to end up looking like this alright I'll have three dimples on",
    "start": 777
  },
  {
    "content": "the cardstock so what I'm going to do is I'm going to finish those up and then",

  },
  {
    "content": "we'll come back to the table we'll do the next step",

  {
    "content": "alright guys so here's our our body of the worm and it's pretty good it's",
    "start": 803
  },
  {
    "content": "fairly solid there but I want to add a little more detail to this it has some",
    "start": 808
  },
  {
    "content": "nice detail with the glue and everything but I would add some more detail and",
    "start": 814
  },
  {
    "content": "strength giving I'm gonna use my my large glue gun and what I'm going to do",
    "start": 817
  },
  {
    "content": "is I'm going to kind of ring this like this see that so it'll kind of give it",
    "start": 824
  },
  {
    "content": "that illusion of the segmentation but it'll also give it strength so I'm going",
    "start": 837
  },
  {
    "content": "to do this on the whole body my glue just ran out so hold on a second and",
    "start": 843
  },
  {
    "content": "then I'll go all the way around the worm and then kind of smooth that out a bit",
    "start": 851
  },
  {
    "content": "alright so now I'll finish that up and then we'll move on to the next step okay",
    "start": 859
  },
  {
    "content": "so I finished the segmentation on this and I think it looks really cool now I",
    "start": 870
  },
  {
    "content": "didn't do the totally covering it I didn't do the absolute back because I'm",
    "start": 875
  },
  {
    "content": "going to put those plates on that so that'll be that'll be okay I want you to",
    "start": 879
  },
  {
    "content": "do that so but now I'm going to do something with the mouth here so I'm",
    "start": 883
  },
  {
    "content": "going to kind of fill that in with a bit of hot glue so I'll just kind of pull",
    "start": 887
  },
  {
    "content": "out big globs of hot alright so I'm going to play with that a bit and then",
    "start": 891
  },
  {
    "content": "we'll come back the next part so I basically put a bowl of hot glue in",
    "start": 899
  },
  {
    "content": "there it's hard to see that in interior there but I I did a little bit of",
    "start": 907
  },
  {
    "content": "texture to by pulling the glue gun out of it after a drying a bit so there we",
    "start": 911
  },
  {
    "content": "go now we'll move on to the next step in this part I'm going to put the teeth",
    "start": 915
  },
  {
    "content": "on because I want to blend them in before I start putting the carapace on",
    "start": 934
  },
  {
    "content": "so what I'll do is I'll just Rim this and then I'll take the mouthpiece and",
    "start": 939
  },
  {
    "content": "the reason I did this first is because I want to blend this in before I put the",
    "start": 958
  },
  {
    "content": "carapace on so I'll just take my glue gun and I'll start just kind of pulling",
    "start": 964
  },
  {
    "content": "so that kind of blends into the rest of the beast",
    "start": 976
  },
  {
    "content": "and we'll finish that up and move on to the next step",
    "start": 981
  },
  {
    "content": "so now what I want to do is apply the carapace sections so I will just take",
    "start": 998
  },
  {
    "content": "one and I'm going to just put some hot glue on it live to the critter so I'm",
    "start": 1004
  },
  {
    "content": "just getting close to the mouth there make sure you keep those ridges don't",
    "start": 1018
  },
  {
    "content": "stretch it out too much alright so there we go so now we'll apply the next one",
    "start": 1023
  },
  {
    "content": "and just make sure you overlap the previous one don't lose your ridges and",
    "start": 1054
  },
  {
    "content": "sound so now we'll just continue that down the back of the worm so here's a",
    "start": 1066
  },
  {
    "content": "mid process application as you can see it's is twisting along with the the",
    "start": 1075
  },
  {
    "content": "segment and body and really the trick to doing this is you can see there's a bit",
    "start": 1079
  },
  {
    "content": "of a curve here so when you put it on there you know twist the cardstock a bit",
    "start": 1085
  },
  {
    "content": "squeeze the squeeze the ridges together and just bend the cardstock a bit to",
    "start": 1092
  },
  {
    "content": "follow the body okay so on they give me kind of a mid body there application and",
    "start": 1098
  },
  {
    "content": "we'll continue with the rest of the segments all right we are back with our",
    "start": 1106
  },
  {
    "content": "character is completed and you can see how that really came out nice gives us",
    "start": 1112
  },
  {
    "content": "some really nice texture I also want to mention that when I did the mouth I",
    "start": 1116
  },
  {
    "content": "forgot to say that I put some white glue on the some dabs of white glue on the",
    "start": 1122
  },
  {
    "content": "teeth that where they connect with the gum because this clay isn't a really",
    "start": 1129
  },
  {
    "content": "solid clay it's a really light clay so I wanted to give it extra strength so so",
    "start": 1133
  },
  {
    "content": "now the next step to this endeavor is to I'm going to add some texture to the the",
    "start": 1139
  },
  {
    "content": "carapace the shell so what I'm going to do is just take the critter and I'll",
