  },
  {
    "content": "there and that looks really cool and really dangerous so now what I got to do",
    "start": 195
  },
  {
    "content": "is just put them to the bit on button on the base this one's actually not flat so",
    "start": 200

    "content": "I'm going to kind of cut it alright so now I'm going to apply these to the base",

  },
  {
    "content": "all right there yeah pretty nasty-looking all right so we'll let",
    "start": 246
  },
  {
    "content": "that dry in the base for a sec and then what I'll do is I'll just cover the base",
    "start": 251
  },
  {
    "content": "the same way that I did the the blind base and I'll paint all these flat black",
    "start": 255
  },
  {
    "content": "and then we'll come back in that paint them up so here's a kind of comparison",

  {
    "content": "between the tendril the tentacles and the tendril effected area so you can see",
    "start": 267
  },
  {
    "content": "the size there okay so we'll be back with the painting",

    "content": "here my tentacles base pain I think they look really great",
    "start": 288
  },
  {
    "content": "now for this this project what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a sequin black",
    "start": 292
  },
  {
    "content": "so I'm gonna water it down and put just apply it to the tentacles",
    "start": 296
  },
  {
    "content": "now the secret black is nice because it gives it kind of a shimmery highlight",
    "start": 303
  },
  {
    "content": "and I that way I can leave it black without because I want to be very black",
    "start": 310

  {
    "content": "so I don't know if I don't think I want to had a dry brush to it so I'm just",

  {
    "content": "gonna paint on this shimmery black don't look very inky black but this will give",
    "start": 322

  {
    "content": "the highlight some definition because of the metallic now what I'm gonna do is",

    "content": "once I finish this I'm going to finish up with the the spines I'm going to do",
    "start": 337

  {
    "content": "the spines that kind of a different color just to set them off from the rest",
    "start": 345

    "content": "of the project you can see also I have a glove on this is kind of messy so these",

  {
    "content": "are just disposable sorry disposable gloves so it will land on myself there",
    "start": 358
  },
  {
    "content": "so make sure you get that all covered and we'll let this dry and we'll move on",
    "start": 366

  {
    "content": "to these spines now you can leave this exactly how it is you wouldn't have to",

  },
  {
    "content": "paint the spines a different color but I want to add a little bit of interest to",
    "start": 377
  },
  {
    "content": "it so I'm going to do that all right see how that metallic is dried",
    "start": 380
  },
  {
    "content": "now and see how it gave a nice Sheen to those tentacles now to finish this up I",
    "start": 391
  },
  {
    "content": "think I'm what I'm going to do is use a blood red on the tentacles and I'll",

  {
    "content": "after this dries for the last color I've got a bright red",
    "start": 419
  },

  {
    "content": "you don't want to paint the whole spine just paint the tips now I'll give you",
    "start": 442

  {
    "content": "like a texture that will give you a variation of color there make a little",
    "start": 450

  {
    "content": "interesting and this isn't going to be real bright I mean I don't want it to be",

  },
  {
    "content": "disposable brush you could use a regular brush as long as you wash it that's the",
    "start": 488
  },
  {
    "content": "great thing about this water base gloss that it will come out of brushes but",
    "start": 492

    "content": "then just cover all the tendrils our tentacles with the gloss and then",
    "start": 499
  },
  {
    "content": "they'll be nice and glossy and Nikki looking so what I'll do is I'll finish",
