    "content": "texture I use the sponge technique which I've shown in another video but I want",

    "content": "sopping wet and see the shape there it makes that easy to get in the crevices",

  },
  {
    "content": "object so basically the for those of you don't know the basics of the technique",
    "start": 283
  },
  {
    "content": "is I just take a flat brush and you can't just run it through the gray the",
    "start": 286
  },
  {
    "content": "pewter gray but I like to just paint it on that gives a nice even texture on the",
    "start": 291
  },
  {
    "content": "sponge right and then you can just stipple it",
    "start": 298
  },
  {
    "content": "on there okay so let's see that texture there all right so now what I do is I",
    "start": 310
  },
  {
    "content": "usually do the two-part technique I use the pewter gray and then I use a dolphin",
    "start": 316

  {
    "content": "gray for highlights okay so we'll let that dry for a minute",
    "start": 321

    "content": "to use my dolphin gray and put a coat of it on the sponge I'm just using the same",

    "content": "sponge all right so now I'll take the sponge and just kind of",
    "start": 334
  },
  {
    "content": "and this will give a nice stone like texture okay so basically that's what I",

    "content": "did with the throne I just did except I just use this edge here to get on this",
    "start": 356
