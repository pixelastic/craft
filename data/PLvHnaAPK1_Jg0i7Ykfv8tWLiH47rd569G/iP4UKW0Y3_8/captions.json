    "content": "bend from the glue so what I like to do is take a heavy object and just put it",

  {
    "content": "haven't had a problem with it so you just do the same thing you just take",
    "start": 451
  },
  {
    "content": "that off and then we'll apply the glue to here I'll go ahead and do that and",
    "start": 454
  },
  {
    "content": "then we'll come back now I've shown you guys before the",

  },
  {
    "content": "came up with and you can see that that texture is on there from the mold really",
    "start": 489
  },
  {
    "content": "nice so what I did was I took my pieces and I measured them put them on this and",
    "start": 491
  },
  {
    "content": "then measured them out now when I originally did these I'm I did them to",

    "content": "try to fit them on that the bricks would fit like a whole grit would fit and half",
    "start": 503

  {
    "content": "bricks would fit on these so when I when I measured these out I measured them out",
    "start": 508
  },
  {
    "content": "that way so I've already cut these out so now let",
    "start": 511
  },
  {
    "content": "me show you that that looks like okay so I've got this wall piece and I've got",
    "start": 514
  },
  {
    "content": "the magnet on one side and it's just the blank cardboard on the other so what I",
    "start": 519
  },
  {
    "content": "need to do is I need to apply these to that and then I'm going to do the same",
    "start": 523
  },
  {
    "content": "thing to this now with this I want to cover up a little bit of magnet so I cut",
    "start": 527
  },
  {
    "content": "a little bit extra in bent that can you see that I bent that over the edge so",
    "start": 533
  },
  {
    "content": "that'll kind of go over that lip and hide that hide that magnet there okay",
    "start": 538
  },
  {
    "content": "so now I just need to apply these so I'm going to take my glue my white glue and",
    "start": 543
  },
  {
    "content": "I'll just put it on there like that and then I'll brush it out",
    "start": 548
  },
  {
    "content": "okay I'll just take that piece I want to get that lip too so I'll put some on",
    "start": 559
  },
  {
    "content": "that lip and then play it over that and I've got to want to hold this down",
    "start": 564
  },
  {
    "content": "because it'll try to they'll try to bend up so I want to hold that down a little",
    "start": 572
  },
  {
    "content": "bit and make sure that it's nice and secure so I'm going to put this one on",
    "start": 576
  },
  {
    "content": "here too and then we'll move on to the next step I've got my wall ready in my",
    "start": 579
  },
  {
    "content": "magic mouth so I'm gonna hot glue that on there okay so let's take my hot glue",
    "start": 596
  },
  {
    "content": "and what's so great about this clay is it's so light that it won't be any kind",
    "start": 599
  },
  {
    "content": "of problem - for the magnets to hold this up okay so let's put a little hot",
    "start": 607
  },
  {
    "content": "glue on there and then I'll where I want now as another effect for this I want to",
    "start": 610
  },
  {
    "content": "have it kind of looking like it's coming out of the wall and that'll be kind of",
    "start": 619
  },
  {
    "content": "fun so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to take my hot glue gun and kind of ring it",
    "start": 622
  },
  {
    "content": "on the edge so this is kind of blend it in and I can do this effect and I'm",

  },
  {
    "content": "going to kind of pull that out okay and that will look like it's kind of coming",
    "start": 635

  {
    "content": "out of the wall there out of the brick I think that'll give a nice effect so",
    "start": 641
  },
  {
    "content": "now I'll just do the bottom and we'll be done with this so I'll go paint this",
    "start": 645
  },
  {
    "content": "flat black and then we'll paint it up so for the brick on the back section of",
    "start": 650
  },
  {
    "content": "the wall I just used a pewter gray in my sponge and I just sponge that on there",
    "start": 672
  },
  {
    "content": "now the nice thing about that is the raised areas picked up the gray but the",
    "start": 677
  },
  {
    "content": "recessed areas stay dark so that's really nice it really gives a nice brick",
    "start": 681

  {
    "content": "effect I did the same thing for the front and you want to be careful when",
    "start": 686
  },
  {
    "content": "you do the magic mouth that you don't get just get too much paint on it which",

  {
    "content": "is easy to do with dimensional objects and you can see a little bit there the",

  {
    "content": "magic mouth the hot glue going into the brick so I think that's a nice effect",

  {
    "content": "and that will be more accentuated when we do the highlight so now for the",

  {
    "content": "highlight I just took a brush a large brush and put a little bit of dolphin",

    "content": "gray on it and just kind of dragged it slightly over the texture of the brick",

  {
    "content": "and that gave it a nice little highlight and for the brick and gave it some more",
