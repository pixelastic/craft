  {
    "content": "to strength okay now basically I need to cut out the",

  {
    "content": "flame so what I'll do is I'll just pick a spot and through a little thick there",

  {
    "content": "got a chunk then I'll just cut off the bottom there and then for the top you",

    "content": "so I'll finish that up and then show you give you a look alright so here's my",

  {
    "content": "plight flame I cut out and the trick to this is you don't want to cut them all",

    "content": "our flames ready and we'll cut out the rest and then",
    "start": 231
  },
  {
    "content": "we'll continue on so I made the base for this out of a thin piece of cardboard",

  },
  {
    "content": "and I applied hot glue to it just ran the hot glue over it that will reinforce",
    "start": 252
  },
  {
    "content": "it so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna I need to start putting the flames on so",

    "content": "we'll continue we'll put the other ones on and then we'll move to the next step",

  {
    "content": "so I'll just start covering up those blue pools and then we'll move on to the",

  },
  {
    "content": "next step so I ever move the excess sand from the base you can see there so there",

  {
    "content": "we go so now the next step is I want to paint this but I want to keep the",

  },
  {
    "content": "translucency of the flame so that's the trick so I'm going to use a yellow and",

  {
    "content": "I'm going to water it down quite a bit so I'm trying to get a very wet yellow",

  {
    "content": "and I'll start just painting it on including over the the sand and then",

  {
    "content": "including the flame so I'll get it nice and I want to make it wet enough that is",
    "start": 438
  },
  {
    "content": "still staying like a translucent okay so now what I'll do is I'll finish this up",
    "start": 448
  },
  {
    "content": "and then we'll move on to the next step I've finished up the yellow and let it",

    "content": "dry and then I have dry brushed on a layer of pumpkin orange put a little bit",

  },
  {
    "content": "on the flames and some of the base and now we'll move to the next step",

    "content": "so now we're just continuing with the same brush with the red and we're just",

  },
  {
    "content": "going to brush them right on there now the rental is kind of like the layer of",
    "start": 485
  },
  {
    "content": "heat I look I think of it as like the lighter the hotter color would be",
    "start": 490
  },
  {
    "content": "underneath the light the darker color so then them for the flame you want to take",
    "start": 495
  },
  {
    "content": "some on your brush and then just kind of pull down or up and there we go so you",
    "start": 499
  },
  {
    "content": "get some nice flame on there okay so now we'll move on to the next step finish",

  {
    "content": "burning and everything so I'm going to kind of do the edge like that and then",

  {
    "content": "go in somewhat so this will make it look like burn or ash or whatever and then",
    "start": 536
  },
  {
    "content": "just fill that out and then you'll be good to go so we'll finish this up and",
