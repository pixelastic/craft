    "content": "cardboard these are like a quarter inch thick or wide I mean and then you'll",

    "content": "notice too that the cardboard is very thin like it's about half the width of a",

    "content": "like keyboard boxes or boxes that are generally inside other boxes when you",

  },
  {
    "content": "get sets and that kind of thing so what I'm going to do is I'll take a couple of",

  },
  {
    "content": "these pieces like here and then I'll just move toothpicks through them",
    "start": 353
  },
  {
    "content": "through the holes so what I'll do is I'll do the first hole actually want to",
    "start": 358
  },
  {
    "content": "do the second cause that's near the end and then I'll just stick it through",
    "start": 366

  {
    "content": "bottoms and this has a sharp on each end so what I've done is for this one I have",
    "start": 385
  },
  {
    "content": "just cut off the toothpicks so what I'll do is I will just take the toothpick and",
    "start": 392
  },
  {
    "content": "take some scissors and just cut off the bottom and that's all there is to it so",
    "start": 403
  },
  {
    "content": "when I put these in so what I'll do is I'll measure two down two holes down",
    "start": 408
  },
  {
    "content": "oops okay so now it's all weird and everything so what I'm gonna do is I'm",
    "start": 416
  },
  {
    "content": "just gonna push down and then you want to get these kind of even you can",
    "start": 422
  },
  {
    "content": "measure if you have to between the two so and once you get that once you get",
    "start": 430
  },
  {
    "content": "that in all you need to do is take your take your glue this is just Elmer's",
    "start": 438
  },
  {
    "content": "glue-all very cheap and then to get it to secure it what I'll do is I'll just",
    "start": 446
  },
  {
    "content": "glue put a dab of glue on each stick so now that I've got that glued I'm just",
    "start": 452
  },
  {
    "content": "going to kind of smear it so it doesn't leave a big gap and once that dries",
    "start": 460
  },
  {
    "content": "it'll be like this okay so now I've got this what I can do is I",
    "start": 466
  },
  {
    "content": "can I've cut these strips that are the width of the cell entrance so what I'll",
    "start": 475
  },
  {
    "content": "do is you can see I've pre-colored these stone and the cells I'll glue the cell",
    "start": 483
  },
  {
    "content": "the bars I'll cut them off I'll cut them off here and they'll glue on this stand",
    "start": 490
  },
  {
    "content": "and that stand will stand in front of the cell now I've glued the base because",
    "start": 495
  },
  {
    "content": "the door was all going to be stoned but I don't want this to be stoned I want",
    "start": 499
  },
  {
    "content": "this to look like metal so I'm gonna paint this separately and then glue it",
    "start": 503
  },
  {
    "content": "on the base I'm also going to take these strips and if I can put them up and down",
    "start": 508
  },
  {
    "content": "and it'll make what looks like the cell door okay so and then that's all there",
    "start": 516
  },
  {
    "content": "is to it so so what I'll do is I'll look at this and I don't need to cut it here",
    "start": 522
  },
  {
    "content": "so I will just cut that all right so now I've got that's that",
    "start": 532
  },
  {
    "content": "those bars so I'll just when I'm ready I'll just",
    "start": 540
  },
  {
    "content": "stand those up and I'll glue it Oh hot glue it onto the base and that'll stand",
    "start": 545
  },
  {
    "content": "up and that would be myself so what I'll do is I'll cut the rest of those out and",
    "start": 549
  },
  {
    "content": "then I'll I'm going to base them black like I did with all the other stuff on",
    "start": 556
  },
  {
    "content": "the tile and then I will just paint it like a metallic to make it look like a",
    "start": 562
  },
  {
    "content": "metal and you'll notice that I painted them",
    "start": 566
  },
  {
    "content": "black bass painting them black I've also put these strips here to kind of",
    "start": 573
  },
  {
    "content": "simulate a door for the cell so I've just based painting the black now what",
    "start": 578
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm gonna do is I'm gonna paint these like a gunmetal so I'm just using",
    "start": 586
  },
  {
    "content": "acrylic paint a gunmetal acrylic paint so I'll just use my brush my large brush",
    "start": 591
  },
  {
    "content": "and I'll get some of that metallic and I'll just start slop it or not so what",
    "start": 599
  },
  {
    "content": "I'll do is I'll do that for the rest of the ones and then I'm gonna put a little",
    "start": 607
  },
  {
    "content": "bit of brown on it to make them look rusty and old and then we'll proceed",
    "start": 613
  },
  {
    "content": "from there now you noticed also too that I have",
    "start": 621
  },
  {
    "content": "three pieces I have two that are just one long piece and these three pieces",
    "start": 623
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm gonna make one of the tiles or one of the cells the door hang the door has",
    "start": 628
  },
  {
    "content": "fallen down the cell bars are bent and this one the cell bars are just straight",
    "start": 634
  },
  {
    "content": "up so it's going to be like the cell overtime just collapsed the bars just",
    "start": 640
  },
  {
    "content": "collapsed in and we're broken into so I'll add some more interest to the tile",
    "start": 647
  },
  {
    "content": "and kind of break it up so I'll finish painting these and I will move on to the",
    "start": 651
  },
  {
    "content": "next step so here we are I've got the cell bars",
    "start": 657
  },
  {
    "content": "painted with the metallic gunmetal and I put a little brown on to age them up",
    "start": 666
  },
  {
    "content": "so what we're the whole idea here is to take these bases that I cut out of card",
    "start": 671
  },
  {
    "content": "stock and paint it with the texture paint and glue them to the basis so they",
    "start": 678
  },
  {
    "content": "will stand up so what I'll do is I'll just use the the glue gun and we'll put",
    "start": 683
  },
  {
    "content": "those two together and then set it on the tile and you want to try to get it",
    "start": 691
  },
  {
    "content": "in the center there and then just hold it for a few seconds and there we go we",
    "start": 700
  },
  {
    "content": "have our standing bars right there okay so now I'll do this other one got a",
    "start": 711
  },
  {
    "content": "string from the glue pen so I will do the other one but first I want to talk",
    "start": 718
  },
  {
    "content": "about this one now this one is it going to be standing up I'm going to have some",
    "start": 725
  },
  {
    "content": "of the pieces laying down like this is the door to the cell I'm going to have",
    "start": 730
  },
  {
    "content": "it laying down and I'm going to have part of the bars standing up so what",
    "start": 733
  },
  {
    "content": "I'll do is so they they all fit I'll start with these bars so I'll glue these",
    "start": 738
  },
  {
    "content": "bars down okay so right there so now I'm going to glue the door so",
    "start": 742
  },
  {
    "content": "stick it on the tile so here's what we got so far I got the door laying down",
    "start": 753
  },
  {
    "content": "and we got these standing bars so now I'm gonna put these bent bars on the",
    "start": 759
  },
  {
    "content": "tile so I'll go like this like they're bent so get the glue on those bars but",
    "start": 764

  {
    "content": "I'm like that and lead them out a bit so it looks like they're coming out so it's",

  {
    "content": "what's so nice about the glue gun it dries almost instantly so there's there",
    "start": 781

  {
    "content": "we go there's the there's what that looks like and so that cell will just be",

  {
    "content": "messed up there you go I'm all set the flock",

  {
    "content": "gonna pour it over the glue and I usually do it on a plate so it's less",
