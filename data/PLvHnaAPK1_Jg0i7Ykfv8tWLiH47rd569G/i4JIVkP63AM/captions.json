    "content": "that simulated cell bars it was the same height as the wall and put it on all",

    "content": "three and I could do the same with a door and you I'll show you how to do",

  },
  {
    "content": "that but there's another way that I prefer what I prefer to do is I will",

  },
  {
    "content": "actually make 3d cell bars that stand up and I'll actually make a door that",
    "start": 327
  },
  {
    "content": "stands up and although those are 3d they won't really obstruct the play area",
    "start": 334

    "content": "because they're not all around if all these were walls sticking up they would",

    "content": "tend to obstruct the players getting in but if there's just cell doors here and",

    "content": "a door here it's still there's a lot of room for the players to get in so you",

  },

    "content": "don't have to worry so much about obstructions like that I'll also do like",

  {
    "content": "set pieces and the center of rooms maybe or I'll do you know added statues or",

  },
  {
    "content": "something to make make more interest in the tile I'm also going to put it great",

  },
  {
    "content": "over this sewer so the players have to try to get that up if they come this way",
    "start": 372
  },
  {
    "content": "so I'll show you how to do that too and we'll move on to that step",
    "start": 379
  },
  {
    "content": "so got three pieces here this won't be the",
    "start": 388
  },
  {
    "content": "door these are the cells and I drew a line for the page and circles to",
    "start": 393
  },
  {
    "content": "represent bars and I'll show you how this put on the pile on the tile but",
    "start": 403
  },
  {
    "content": "first I'll just show you how I did those bars will quick just take a piece and",
    "start": 409
  },
  {
    "content": "I've cut it because the cells are angled so I've cut it in an angle so I'm just",
    "start": 413
  },
  {
    "content": "going to get a straight edge just make a little easier so I'll have to draw it",
    "start": 418
  },
  {
    "content": "I want straight line myself and then just draw a straight line so I've got",
    "start": 424
  },
  {
    "content": "that and then I'll just go down the tile and just draw circles good better hold",
    "start": 429
  },
  {
    "content": "on that three a little bit there I have to be",
    "start": 440
  },
  {
    "content": "exact okay",
    "start": 450
  },
  {
    "content": "and so that's just a quick and dirty way to do your bars and I'll put those on",
    "start": 456
  },
  {
    "content": "the tile and show you how they look okay so this is the tile with the bars",
    "start": 461
  },
  {
    "content": "of the door on it so you can see I've put these here and you can glue this",
    "start": 470
  },
  {
    "content": "down if you want and you could even cut us thing out for a cell door and have",
    "start": 476
  },
  {
    "content": "that open if you want I've got the door over here and I didn't glue that down so",
    "start": 481
  },
  {
    "content": "that you could have the characters go through that door and you can open it",
    "start": 489
  },
  {
    "content": "you know either way you want it so to simulate that the door was open",
    "start": 494
  },
  {
    "content": "so that's a nice little technique quick and dirty to do that type of stuff but",
    "start": 497
  },
  {
    "content": "like I say I like to add a little more embellishment as far as like actually",
    "start": 503
  },
  {
    "content": "having the cell bars and like a 3d door and I'll show you how to do that now",
    "start": 507
  },
  {
    "content": "now I want to create a 3d door and what I'm gonna do is cut it out of cardboard",
    "start": 518
  },
  {
    "content": "now here's the cardboard tile that are the cardboard I've used now this",
    "start": 525

    "content": "cardboard and I'll talk about that in some of the videos that you want to use",

  {
    "content": "thicker or thinner cardboard so just give it more weight now for the",

  {
    "content": "background of the fortress I decided that these overs have taken it over and",

  },
  {
    "content": "they've kind of smashed through the walls because the dwarf doors weren't",
    "start": 546
  },
  {
    "content": "big enough for them to get through so I could go a couple styles I could do",
    "start": 550
  },
  {
    "content": "something like this or I thought I would go like this do they kind of keep it war",
    "start": 554
  },
  {
    "content": "feeling but that it's smashed through now what I'm going to do is I'm also I",
    "start": 559
  },
  {
    "content": "have also cut these triangles and I'm going to glue them on here and then I",
    "start": 565
  },
  {
    "content": "will cut off the tips where this where they enter the smash part and that'll",
    "start": 572
  },
  {
    "content": "give it a little bit of interest it'll give it a little bit of dimension to the",
    "start": 577
  },
  {
    "content": "door and then once I get all that together I'm going to put a glue it to",
    "start": 581
  },
  {
    "content": "the bottom so that it'll stand up and this is just some card stock I've cut so",
    "start": 591
  },
  {
    "content": "I'll go ahead and cut this out and then I'll show you how we put it together",

  },
  {
    "content": "so now our door is cut and as you can see it's a little",
    "start": 605
  },
  {
    "content": "thicker than the regular cardboard so I'm going to do is I'm going to take our",
    "start": 611
  },
  {
    "content": "trusty glue gun it's warmed up and I'll pull it in and I'll put some glitter",
    "start": 614
  },
  {
    "content": "there the bottom this and then I'll take our piece of cardstock we cut and I will",
    "start": 620
  },
  {
    "content": "stick it in the center there seven I'll let that dry for a second so now we have",
    "start": 628
  },
  {
    "content": "a vertical door now one thing you'll notice though is that you can see the",
    "start": 637
  },
  {
    "content": "top of the corrugation so here you can see the corrugation and that kind of",
    "start": 644
  },
  {
    "content": "looks ugly doesn't look very good on the tile it's not a problem because it's",
    "start": 650

  {
    "content": "flat so you don't really see that toric corrugation but when you have something",
    "start": 655
  },
  {
    "content": "standing up you can see it and with something that's thick it's kind of",
    "start": 658
  },
  {
    "content": "annoying so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a strip of cardstock that",
    "start": 662
  },
  {
    "content": "I've cut and I've got to put it on that put it on the door and then this door",
    "start": 668
  },
  {
    "content": "has a slight Bend so I'm going to bend it there and then I'm gonna",
    "start": 674
  },
  {
    "content": "and then I'll just spend it there and bend it there and bend it there and I'll",
    "start": 683
  },
  {
    "content": "just spend it all the way down and cut it off so what I'll do is I'll put the",
    "start": 688
  },
  {
    "content": "glue on there and you can cut these individually pieces if you want but",
    "start": 692
  },
  {
    "content": "careful you don't burn your fingers and so I'll hold that down so dries just",

  {
    "content": "pretty quickly sorry blocking away there okay",
    "start": 723
  },
  {
    "content": "so I've got all around the door and I'll just cut that off there",
    "start": 734
  },
  {
    "content": "so there we go we got the door and you can see that it covers up the",

  {
    "content": "corrugation so that's a nice little trick now I like I said I want to add a",

  {
    "content": "little bit of interest to the tile so I'm going to take these little triangle",
    "start": 763

  {
    "content": "strips that I made and put it on there but see how it goes into the broken door",
    "start": 768

  {
    "content": "so I'm going to mark that cut that off I'll take my glue gun",
    "start": 774

  {
    "content": "so and then I've got to put one here one here and on the same on the reverse side",

    "content": "so I'll go ahead and finish that and then we'll take a look at the door I was",
