  {
    "content": "can just make your wheels out of cardstock or cardboard now I'm going to",
    "start": 254
  },
  {
    "content": "do is to add little extra detail to the wheels I'm going to take my miter box",

  {
    "content": "and I'm going to put the wheel down and I want to make divided the wheel in half",

  },
  {
    "content": "wheel itself so it looks like the wheel is",

    "content": "as it divided so before you can see that so when I paint it up it won't just look",
    "start": 283
  },
  {
    "content": "like a round disc it'll have it divided in it it's a little more added interest",
    "start": 293
  },
  {
    "content": "so what I'm going to do is I'm going to glue it on with the glue gun this time",
    "start": 297
  },
  {
    "content": "since these are a little more substantial so I'm going to glue the",
    "start": 304
  },
  {
    "content": "axle on first okay so I've got the exelon you can see so now I'll glue the",
    "start": 309
  },
  {
    "content": "wheels on so I'll put a dab there and just try to get it centered",
    "start": 331
  },
  {
    "content": "there you go got that I'll do the other wheel",
    "start": 342
  },
  {
    "content": "and then you want to put that down to make sure that it works is the one",
    "start": 355
  },
  {
    "content": "wheels not too crazy that they're the same on both sides",
    "start": 364
  },
  {
    "content": "so you go I got my wheels on so now what I'm going to do is I am going to make",
    "start": 369
  },
  {
    "content": "the pull pieces for the front so I'm just going to measure so I'm going to",

  },
  {
    "content": "measure two inches for each piece I'll cut this with a miter",
    "start": 397
  },
  {
    "content": "so now I'm just going to put those underneath like that okay so I get my",
    "start": 427
  },
  {
    "content": "glue gun okay got the two so I got that like that so there we go we got the",
    "start": 444
  },
  {
    "content": "wagon so now what I'm going to do is I am going to cut sticks for the body of",
    "start": 463
  },
  {
    "content": "the wagon to hold the hay in so I'll just get my mitre out and I've already",
    "start": 475
  },
  {
    "content": "cut these toys mark these to one inch I'll just cut all these pieces",
    "start": 480
  },
  {
    "content": "I got those cuts over sandy stand the edges off so now I'm going to use the",
    "start": 489
  },
  {
    "content": "white glue for this part and I'm going to glue to one the corner here so let's",
    "start": 516
  },
  {
    "content": "put a dead white glue my stick I'll just I put it all the way down next",
    "start": 524
  },
  {
    "content": "one I've got those two they're in the excess glue just wipe it off don't worry",
    "start": 531
  },
  {
    "content": "so now you can see I've got the edges of the hay wagon there so there we go and",
    "start": 581
  },
  {
    "content": "let that dry and then I'll put another detail on there",
    "start": 594
  },
  {
    "content": "okay so I've got an issue I've got a hay wagon with no hay in it so how am I",
    "start": 605
  },
  {
    "content": "going to do that there are different ways you could do it but a way that I",
    "start": 612
  },
  {
    "content": "found that works really well is to do this take a plate with some water in it",
    "start": 615
  },
  {
    "content": "and then I'm going to take some white glue and just mix it in the water and",
    "start": 623
  },
  {
    "content": "then just stir it up mixes in now what I'm going to do is use this solution I'm",
    "start": 635
  },
  {
    "content": "going to take some toilet paper and I'll take a piece and let's dip it in the",
    "start": 652
  },
  {
    "content": "water and I'll wring it out then I get kind of a just a wet blob and then I'm",
    "start": 659
  },
  {
    "content": "going to put it in the cart now one nice thing about this besides",
    "start": 671
  },
  {
    "content": "using a clay or something would be that the clay would be much heavier when this",
    "start": 679
  },
  {
    "content": "dries it will be pretty light when the water evaporates and it dries it'll be",
    "start": 686
  },
  {
    "content": "pretty light so there I've got a clump but I want to make some more hay in it",
    "start": 689
  },
  {
    "content": "so I'm gonna use another piece of toilet paper stop up somewhere squeeze it out",
    "start": 696
  },
  {
    "content": "and then okay so I've got it almost filled up but I think I want to put a",
    "start": 704
  },
  {
    "content": "little more so I want to put it more towards the head because I want the",
    "start": 726
  },
  {
    "content": "wagon to be to go down so soften up the end bring it out",
    "start": 730
  },
  {
    "content": "it's pretty pliable so you can just pretty much mold it to whatever shape",
    "start": 742
  },
  {
    "content": "you want in there so I got it in the wagon so now you can see the wagon leans",
    "start": 745
  },
  {
    "content": "forward instead of leaning back so all right so what I'm going to do now is now",
    "start": 762
  },
  {
    "content": "I've got that on there I'm going to have just a little extra glue on it around",
    "start": 770
  },
  {
    "content": "the edges this will kind of help it stay on",
    "start": 777
  },
  {
    "content": "since when we Dylan in the glue down it wasn't full strength so just kind of",
    "start": 802
  },
  {
    "content": "smooth that on and now we'll just let that dry and that will take about it",
    "start": 809
  },
  {
    "content": "that'll take about a day to dry so nothing you can rush through you know in",
    "start": 827
  },
  {
    "content": "warm weather it could take less but it'll take about a day but that will be",
    "start": 838
  },
  {
    "content": "a nice hard mass when it dries and it'll be light if you did that if you did a",
    "start": 841
  },
  {
    "content": "hunk of clay or something it put is molded and put it on there it'd be very",
    "start": 850
  },
  {
    "content": "happy if you make this piece very heavy with that it's going to be much much",
    "start": 853
  },
  {
    "content": "lighter than if you put a chunk of clay on there so there we go we'll let that",
    "start": 858
  },
  {
    "content": "dry and we'll go to the next step you",
