    "start": 163
  },
  {
    "content": "Ledge on each side and this was the wall and then I had a pit okay and the pit",
    "start": 168
  },
  {
    "content": "was about 50 feet deep now I had a ice bridge going across okay so that's the",
    "start": 177
  },
  {
    "content": "bridge so this bridge is like magically created out of ice it's very thin so it",
    "start": 185

    "content": "down are these jagged stones so I basically had almost like teeth like",

    "content": "pointed stones okay and these were all the way down okay now there was also",
    "start": 199
  },
  {
    "content": "wind coming up from below so it was kind of a swirling gust of wind coming up",
    "start": 206

  {
    "content": "fairly strong coming up from the bottom so now if they went to the next room the",
    "start": 213
  },
  {
    "content": "next room was a cavern okay and it had it ended in an area that went up okay so",
    "start": 220
  },
  {
    "content": "this went this you'd have to go about 20 feet up to go up all right now the room",
    "start": 233
  },
  {
    "content": "is this room is sloped like 30 degrees so it's kind of like this much of a",
    "start": 239
  },
  {
    "content": "slope okay and it was it was made of ice all right - this room is all ice okay",
    "start": 243
  },
  {
    "content": "and I'll show you this on another I'll show you the ice cream on another video",
    "start": 252

  {
    "content": "and how I did that so the idea was that they could get across here there'd be a",
    "start": 255
  },
  {
    "content": "nice room but and below this other room was a kind of a square room but I had it",
    "start": 262

  {
    "content": "had corners that were kind of like hexagonal I guess like this okay and it",

    "content": "was creating this whirlwind that was kicking up through here okay I also had",

  },
  {
    "content": "metal plates on each of these walls okay so the trick was not only to get",
    "start": 290
  },
  {
    "content": "across this but to get through this room to okay now I had I had some stuff that",
    "start": 305
  },
  {
    "content": "would attack the players and I'll get to that in the other video but the thing I",
    "start": 310
  },
  {
    "content": "want to stress is I knew my mage would be skittish in this room okay and so I",
    "start": 314
  },
  {
    "content": "made this room highly magical they were sharp I told them there are sharp",
    "start": 322
  },
  {
    "content": "icicles hanging down kind of sparkling with magic and so he got really really",
    "start": 327
  },
  {
    "content": "nervous with that all right so he decided all right I'm going to dispel",
    "start": 333
  },
  {
    "content": "this okay so what I had was all this ice in this room instantly turned the water",

  },
  {
    "content": "shoots down this 30-degree incline pushes them into this pit which of",
    "start": 348
  },
  {
    "content": "course when the water starts flowing in here the water force is so strong they",

  },
  {
    "content": "can't resist it pushes them into this room of course it becomes like a drain",

    "content": "where they're getting raked against these rocks so they have to make",

  {
    "content": "the air elemental so it's making this whirlpool the center of the tile they do",
    "start": 374
  },
  {
    "content": "end up a couple of them go down actually they do end up coming out of it but it",
    "start": 381
  },
  {
    "content": "was a pretty rough encounter now the trick with this one was these areas",
    "start": 386
  },
  {
    "content": "these areas were filled with sand okay so if they would have end up dispelling",
    "start": 393
  },
  {
    "content": "this air elemental all the gates go push and come down and then this sand pours",
    "start": 400
  },
  {
    "content": "out so it would have been like basically like quicksand in this with all the",
    "start": 406
  },
  {
    "content": "water and everything but they didn't end up dispelling this so they didn't have",
    "start": 411
  },
  {
    "content": "that they didn't have that problem at least but so this was kind of a",
    "start": 414
  },
  {
    "content": "multi-part trap depending on what they did now if they if they wouldn't have",
    "start": 417
  },
  {
    "content": "dispelled this I had some ice walls that were going to attack them and try to",
    "start": 422
  },
  {
    "content": "push them off anyway into this area and they could really",
    "start": 425
  },
  {
    "content": "easily retreat because of this ice bridge they had basically they came up",
    "start": 429
  },
  {
    "content": "with a pretty genius idea they kind of straddled it and put a rope",
    "start": 433
  },
  {
    "content": "around in their hands so they could just kind of like crawl across like this and",
    "start": 439
  },
  {
    "content": "I thought that was a pretty genius idea but anyways so they they even if they",
    "start": 445
  },
  {
    "content": "slip they'd be okay so they got across that way so but yeah so there were",
    "start": 450
  },
  {
    "content": "multiple ways that this could have gone down most of them not very well but but",
    "start": 454
  },
  {
    "content": "anyways now you see the kind of setup of this of this area so what I'm going to",
    "start": 458
  },
  {
    "content": "do in this video is I will I'm going to do kind of a multi-part video so I'm",
    "start": 465
  },
  {
    "content": "going to show you this whole part here okay and then I'll do some other videos",
    "start": 469

  {
    "content": "I might put these in the same video but I'll do more videos showing the rest of",
    "start": 474
  },
  {
    "content": "this of this whole trap and so there you go that's how everything all worked",
    "start": 480
  },
  {
    "content": "together and so let's go to the table and I'll show you how I crafted this",
    "start": 486

  {
    "content": "nasty pit with the ring with these razor-sharp stones",
    "start": 490
  },
  {
    "content": "the cave tiles started out as a standard cave tile you can see I used a double",

  {
    "content": "thick cardboard because not because of the technique but it did work with the",
    "start": 514
  },
  {
    "content": "technique what I was going for was the dragon cave and I had rather large tiles",
    "start": 520
  },
  {
    "content": "so I ended up using the double thick cardboard but it ended up working out",
    "start": 524
  },
  {
    "content": "pretty well because I cut the bottom piece off and then I put the side ledges",
    "start": 529
  },
  {
    "content": "on there and then I put the like I do with a standard cave tile and measured",
    "start": 540
  },
  {
    "content": "the wall and then attached it so so basically I was ready to go so after",
    "start": 544
  },
  {
    "content": "that point which I don't show I attached the triangular shaped regular thickness",
    "start": 551
  },
  {
    "content": "cardboard to create the Razr rocks now in this picture I've advanced",
    "start": 558

  {
    "content": "somewhat and you can see the tile is painted so I've given it the coat of the",
    "start": 566
  },
  {
    "content": "spray texture paint then I painted the center with a black and then I",
    "start": 570
  },
  {
    "content": "highlighted the razor rocks with some dolphin gray and then you can see I use",
    "start": 577
  },
  {
    "content": "some pewter gray and painted more rows of rocks kind of diminishing off into",
    "start": 582
  },
  {
    "content": "the distance so that kind of gave a sense of depth to this pit and I think",
    "start": 587

    "content": "that was a really nice technique now the ice bridge is simply just a",

  {
    "content": "piece of cardboard that I've cut and bent and what I did to get the bend was",
    "start": 607

    "content": "I glued some cardstock on each end and that helped keep the",

    "content": "glue to cover the bend that I used to make the the bridge pop-up and after",
    "start": 625

    "content": "that I painted it a primer gray okay because I was going for ice so I could",
    "start": 635

  {
    "content": "have painted it white but white doesn't stick very well to cardboard I find the",
    "start": 642

  {
    "content": "gray is a better starting spot so I use the gray primer then I used white",

    "content": "acrylic right and light blue acrylic on it to give it kind of an icy look and at",
    "start": 652

  {
    "content": "this point I got some very small glitter and this gave it a really nice kind of",
    "start": 659
  },
  {
    "content": "Sheen and sparkle that made it look like ice so I rubbed a little bit of PVA",
    "start": 669

    "content": "white glue on the bridge after the paint dried and then sprinkled some of this",
    "start": 675

    "content": "glitter on it okay so at that point I decided I wanted to give it like the icy",
